srelma,"&gt;Were reporting something like 140k deaths in the US, 

Who is reporting this number? [This](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) says 97k. [This](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) says 96k. Pretty much the same (the small difference must be coming from differences when data is updated). 

&gt;CDC is working to display actual covid deaths, these numbers are updated weekly and daily. Turns out were only at about 74k. Half of whats reported. [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm)

74k number is for ""COVID-19 deaths"". In addition there is a column labelled ""Deaths with pneumonia and COVID-19"". That's 32k. If you add these two together, you get pretty close to the numbers above. 

But sure, there is a grey area, what exactly is a ""COVID-19"" death. If COVID-19 destroys your lungs and then you get pneumonia that kills you, is that a ""COVID-19 death""? If you're weakened by cancer and then COVID-19 pushes you over the edge and you die. Is that a COVID-19 death? 

Furthermore, that CDC data shouldn't be compared with the online data for the latest situation because it is clearly delayed. That data records deaths according to the actual date of death, while the online data is just the latest deaths without any attempt to classify when these people died. So, you can very well have statistics that have deaths that we know occurred, but not more than that, for instance when exactly the death happened. If that data is not available, it is unlikely to be added to that table. As you can see for the COVID-19 deaths, they are much higher in April than May, with the latest data (deaths in the week ending 5/16) with only 1500 cases, which is about 1/10th of the peak value. If you compare this to the other sources that I listed, they show only a relatively modest fall (\~20-30%) in deaths since the peak. The most likely explanation is that the CDC data for the latest couple of weeks does not include all the cases yet. Once they are added, the number will match with the other sources. 

&gt;You cant keep a lockdown going until the Virus is gone. The Vaccine is 18 months away at best.

Correct. Fortunately, going back to the situation in February (=reopen everything as they were then) and staying in lockdown until the vaccine is ready are not the only two options. 

&gt; Time to fucking move on, people are going to die regardless, the CDC now reports that covid doesnt spread easily by contact, whicheans if you wear a mask and wash your hands like a normal human being, youre as good as you can be.

Do you have good suggestions for how to make for instance people in Michigan to wear masks? 

But yes, I support phased removal of social distancing measures.  

&gt;The lockdowns didnt stop people from going out and doing shit, so lets say we double the number dead reported by the CDC, that brings us to 148k or so. The us has a population of 340 million. Sorry, its not significant.

Immuno-Guy-PhD,"The models weren't wrong mathematically, they were just extremely bad at predicting human behavior. When you tell billions of people over and over again that their parents and grandparents are gonna die or they could wind up in the ICU, they perk up and listen. Voluntary mitigation efforts were over and above what any of these models predicted at all.

If you look at the methods used by the ICL group who famously predicted that 2.2 million Americans would die without non-pharmaceutical interventions, they basically predicted 50-75% compliance with all these measures. As in, they figured in the government mandated social distancing, then we'd still have 25% the number of birthday parties, house parties, movie nights, group trips, etc... He assumed that 30% of people who were diagnosed would basically say, ""fuck it, I'm going out anyway.""

Then some researchers from Sweden in early April took that same model and cried out to their government, ""look, there will be 96,000 deaths by the end of June if we continue down this path."" The government ignored that report and continued. Today they are around under 4,000 deaths. Why? Because people take precautions. Because even when you *don't* mandate social distancing, house parties and birthday parties and movie nights plummet to well below 30% of normal values in the middle of a once-in-a-century deadly pandemic.

We may find the true challenge is not in containing this to well below Ferguson's best case scenario 1.1 million deaths, but in managing to get people to safely spend money to keep the economy going.

It's all rather speculative at this point, and Sweden is sustaining economic damage despite not implementing strict lockdowns.

* relative seriousness
* how it spreads and the effect of preventative measures

Quadrupleawesomeness,"&gt; The decision to implement a system of quarantine cannot be justified or grounded in the notion of effectiveness simply determined in scientific terms. Uncertainty is never fully resolved, and as such, evidence-based decisionmaking ought to be used to reflect on what constitutes a reasonable and well-justified decision—not because it was scientifically measured or objectively assessed but because it can serve as a process of reasoned or deliberated justification, a process that would serve us well in making public health decisions and justifying the use of restrictive measures during public health emergencies.

&gt;The tendency to impart a fixed set of prescriptions and to reduce complex situations to technical problems resolvable by scientific expertise can be compelling in the face of so much uncertainty. Yet, in a democratic society, expertise cannot legitimately be limited and left to scientific experts. By validating other legitimate interests and perspectives in public health decisionmaking, we are simply acknowledging what is already a reality in how decisions are made, especially as they relate to quarantine. It is, therefore, incumbent on us to recognize and legitimize a broader notion of effectiveness—one that transcends the dominant conception that it derives from a set of proven and verifiable data to one that gives a voice to nonscientific, nontechnical perspectives, experiences, preferences, and cultural commitments. Such efforts are essential and not accidental.

This mask wearing MUST be coupled with social distancing practices, or else the marginal benefits that cloth masks may provide will be inconsequential beyond signaling your seriousness about the pandemic. 

I think it’s important to note this [Hamster study—https://www.google.com/amp/s/medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-hamster-masks-coronavirus-scientists.amp) may be the most favorable research in support of masks. 

An earlier RCT study (https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577.short) found significant drawbacks in the effectiveness of preventing disease transmission when it came to cloth masks. 

I’ve been pointing people to this study to stress the importance that MASK WEARING ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH.

RogueDevlin,"Yes, testing could be done. 

The government does not want to, for a lot of reasons.  

First, the man in charge (Lopez Gatell) holds a grudge when he was fired during the H1N1 break, because the president at the time did not accept his Sentinel method to count the cases, and discovered a lot of inconsistencies with his data.  

The current president loaths that previous president, so he put the fired guy in charge with his Sentinel method.  

Testing everyone will prove that the measures taken by the government were irresponsible and late. 

It was mid March when government offices were sending  out visual communication staying there was nothing to worry about. They allowed a large concert in Mexico City (Vive Latino). The president himself posted a video on his Twitter telling the people to go out and enjoy restaurants. He was touring the country, rallying people and greeting and kissing everyone. In March!  

It is not completely true that we pay everything out of the pocket. There is social security for a lot of people. But in another idiotic move, the president disappeared the Seguro Popular for people that could not apply to any health benefits and changed it to his own model. The system was in chaos when the pandemic hit. Contracts for medicines has been halted with laboratories.  

The government also decided to sell a lot of facemasks to China in February, which now they say, it may have been a mistake. But at the same time Lopez Gatell was continuously regarded the use of facemasks as not necessary and to significant for every day use.  

And last, the government has made it clear their only concern is the Oil, the Mayan Train, the populist handouts and baseball. Fundings are going towards that. There has been almost zero stimulus to companies or to people who have lost their jobs.  

Going specific intro testing, the government initially centralized all nationwide testing in one institute in Mexico City. Slow and ineffective process. The government forbade private labs and hospitals  to do tests. And the criteria was very specific. It took more than a month for other labs and hospitals to start testingd the requirements were still very strict.  

At this point, the data presented in the daily conferences, does not include the results of people being tested in private labs.

Numerous new cases of corona after service in Frankfurt

Surrounding districts also affected by corona infections

Church services are permitted again in Hesse

Frankfurt - At a service of the Evangelical Christian Baptist Church in Frankfurt, a large number of people were infected with Corona. Believers from the entire Rhine-Main area are affected. This was confirmed to the Frankfurter Rundschau by Antoni Walczok, deputy director of the Frankfurt Health Office. ""This is a very dynamic event."" He couldn't say how many people are sick or infected. The country has been informed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The outbreak did not only affect Frankfurt, but also surrounding districts to a greater or lesser extent, such as the Wetterau, Hochtaunus, and Main-Kinzig districts. According to the Main-Kinzig-Kreis, 16 people in Hanau alone tested positive and were assigned to the cluster.

&amp;#x200B;

Corona crisis in Frankfurt: church services allowed again

The prayer house of the Evangelical Christian Baptist congregation is located at Eschborner Landstraße 99-101 in Frankfurt. The service was celebrated there on Sunday, 10 May, during which the believers are said to have been infected. Association chairman Eugen Steiger is in hospital, his daughter told the FR on the phone. Afterwards a woman's voice intervened: ""We don't have to give you an answer"" - and ended the conversation abruptly.

&amp;#x200B;

In doing so, the community did not do anything illegal. On May 10, church services were allowed again in Hesse, Walczok said. Unlike in the catering industry, for example, registration of visitors with their names and addresses was not mandatory. The rules of distance and hygiene must be observed. There are no guidelines regarding the number of participants. ""There was no violation of a legal ordinance,"" the deputy head of the office makes clear.

&amp;#x200B;

Corona in Frankfurt: Churches must develop their own concept

The lack of a registration requirement makes the work of the competent health authorities difficult. They now have the task of locating possible contact persons and ordering quarantine - or isolation for those who are less seriously ill.

&amp;#x200B;

Following the update of the regulations on the Corona crisis, religious communities have been allowed to reassemble since 1 May. To this end, churches and religious communities must develop their own concept for maintaining the rules of distance, hygiene and access control and coordinate it with the Länder and the Robert Koch Institute. 

&amp;#x200B;

Corona in Frankfurt: Individual event can have fatal consequences

A minimum distance of 1.5 metres must be maintained between persons who do not live together in the same household. Objects such as the collection basket may not be passed on. ""Hygienic measures such as the placement of disinfectant dispensers must be ensured"", says the corresponding communication from the state government.

&amp;#x200B;

On Friday (22.05.2020) Main-Kinzig District Administrator Thorsten Stolz and Health Department Head Susanne Simmler (both SPD) appealed to the population not to become careless. ""As this outbreak in Frankfurt shows, a single event with a large number of different contacts can have far-reaching consequences for the incidence of infection"". The public health authorities concerned would now have their hands full with explaining as many infection routes as possible and thus preventing further infections.

yogthos,"Yeah, that's really the most frustrating part. People keep talking about it as if it's hypothetical, but we already know exactly what to expect based on what happened in other places. There are basically three scenarios:

The approach most Asian countries took is universal masking, mass testing, and good contact tracing. This contains the pandemic without the need to do a lockdown, and without mass infections.

Lockdown approach that a lot of European countries and Canada went with since the level of preparedness was lower than in Asia. It's more painful than the Asian approach, but it does get the pandemic under control, and allows ramping up measures to start opening up safely.

Finally, there the herd immunity approach that countries like Sweden, UK, Italy, and Spain tried. This looks to be the most destructive approach that overwhelms the healthcare system resulting in mass deaths.

I think it's criminal that US having had both plenty of warning and time to prepare is letting the population down through what amount to complete and utter incompetence on the part of the government.

my_two_pence,"I support the strategy, and I'll explain why. Sorry for the long post. TLDR: The metric used is more complex than any single number, and the strategy is long-term.

First: Sweden's approach is more holistic, not looking at only the spread of the virus, but also at things like mental health, domestic violence, children's education, vitamin D deficiency (a real problem every early spring!), etc, etc... If a harder lock-down could have prevented an additional 1000 deaths, but at the additional cost of 100 women beaten by their husbands, 10,000 children falling behind in school, and 10,000 jobs lost, is it the right choice to make? There is no right answer of course, but there is a wrong one: ignoring everything except the death rate is not right. Yet it's what everyone always seems to do in these discussions. The decision to keep elementary schools open came from this, since we don't want a ""lost generation"" of schoolchildren too young to learn effectively on-line.

Second: Sweden's strategy is *significantly* more long-term than any other country's. While other countries have set dates for when they will open their countries back up, and then pushed those dates forward, Sweden have said from the start that their measures may have to stay in place until mass vaccination is complete *in 2-5 years' time*. What will happen when countries open back up? Germany saw their R-number rise above 1.0 again, and had to partially backtrack, for instance. This will not happen to Sweden, since we aren't planning on lifting the restrictions.

Some governments are hoping that Test, Trace, and Isolate (TTI) will prevent a second wave, but we seem to forget that we were doing TTI before the first wave! All through late January and February, most European countries (with the notable exception of the UK) did contact tracing of their Covid cases, but were unable to stop the wave from materializing. Sure, we've learned more since then, but can we really be confident that a second wave won't happen?

Third: The strategy is working! The death rate is currently half of what it was at its peak! Out ICU's have never been full (and no, old people were *not* being denied intensive care any more than they normally are, except for a few individual cases at one hospital, which is being investigated). We have had fewer deaths per capita than Belgium, Spain, Italy, the UK, France, New York State, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and are about to be overtaken by several US states, the US as a whole, Russia, and probably Brazil. I don't really understand why people seem so eager to complain at Sweden, when we are arguably doing better than many other countries.

Also, there is a lot of misinformation going around. Since herd immunity isn't, and has never been, the goal of the Swedish strategy, having to push the herd immunity date forward is not a failure. It's actually a success, since it means that you were better at preventing people from catching the disease than you thought you were going to be. Also, a lot of people seem to think that Sweden's strategy is to do nothing except issue vague recommendations, which is absolutely not the case. There are strict rules *as well as* recommendations, and there are businesses that have been fined and shut down for breaking those rules.

You are right in one thing tough: The lack of adequate tests is a failure. And the government have admitted this, saying that they haven't reached the testing targets they sought. Also, that the disease was allowed to spread into our nursing homes is a tragedy, and this has also been admitted by the government. It seems to have happened because we lacked a strategic emergency supply of PPE beforehand, which I'll gladly admit is extremely dumb.",1590245246,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gp2y7y/sweden_isnt_anywhere_close_to_reaching_herd/frjxh4k/,measures,2020-05-23

False optimism might be a thing, but national pride is taboo, and mass delusion very hard in a country with high education, free media and no agenda behind the official reporting.

We want to survive the pandemic with as few casualties and little destruction as possible.
The FHM agency has chosen to keep the health care system from overload, and otherwise minimise their interference.

As a citizen, I understand that the best way to keep people from dying is to minimise spread, help people cope with the lock down measures and try to make sure the hospitals can take care of those who don't have other options.

Closing down the schools and the economy seems like it would put a lot of people through undue hardship and would actually hit the healthcare system quite hard (something like 1/3 of all health care staff were expected to have to stay home with kids if schools close). And the FHM have been very open with why and how they're made their calls, as well as that they're constantly re-evaluating as they learn more. 

There are some weird situations around where the line is drawn, but for most cases, the spread reduction seems effective. We're not the lowest in the world, but our R-rate (0,83 +/- 0,02 last week) is on par with Norway, Denmark and Germany's good weeks, who've had complete lockdown for 2 months (although Finland and Iceland are indeed impressively lower).

A New Approach to Handling the Pandemic. 

The conundrum facing the country in the era of Covid19 is that, on one hand, the curve of hospitalizations must be bent enough so that the medical system is not overwhelmed and, on the other hand, the country must be reopened before it falls into a further devastating economic depression.  So far the only solutions put forth to opening the country are “testing” and “tracing” as ‘self-isolation’ is slowly being lifted.  If a spike is detected then restrictions are reimposed.   The problems here are many.  The US doesn’t have anywhere close to the amount of testing necessary to make this an effective strategy. The logistical infrastructure for tracing doesn’t exist. But even more important, this is a formula for further economic collapse.   By putting massive amounts of restriction on businesses while reopening, many businesses will become unprofitable and there will be a massive influx in bankruptcy. For example, the profit margins in the service industry are already razor thin.  If restaurants  are only allowed to operate at half capacity then virtually all small, sitdown restaurants will go bankrupt.

So what should we do differently?  How do we reopen the country in a manner that returns the economy to the ‘black’ while at the same time bending the curve so that the medical infrastructure is not overwhelmed.   The solution is simple:  We need a Reverse Quarantine.  There are certain identifiably factors that make individuals and groups much more at risk of hospitalization if they contract Covid19.  The medical professionals and statisticians need to first identify those factors with the data available.   Then we must quickly establish an infrastructure of ‘Safe Zones’ which will be put under quarantine. This would involve both communities and individual houses.  By this we mean a true quarantine by which they would be kept fully separated from society and fully logistically supported just like the nation supports its troops when they are at war.    Only after the infrastructure of safe zones is established we then reopen the country.  We still monitor the medical system for spikes and, if and when they happen,  rather than reclosing society, identify the new vulnerable groups and extend the safe zones.  This way the economy could rapidly be reopened in a manner that will return it to profitability while at the same time keeping the medical system from being overwhelmed.  Then when an effective treatment, cure or vaccine for Covid19 is found we can then open the safe zones and reintegrate society.

If we do not use a bold approach to combat this pandemic but instead use this “baby steps into the water” approach the US is going to fail at both flattening the curve and fall into a depression that will devastated the economic well being of the country.   The Reverse Quarantine is the only way to resolve this conundrum.",1590183320,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gojqi1/daily_discussion_post_may_22_questions_images/frhnxvt/,safe,2020-05-22

chapodestroyer69,"Damn you're right. If only she'd realize that and start reopening the state. Oh wait.

&gt;Whitmer's announcement comes a day after she made several changes to further relax a sweeping stay-at-home order that has been in place since March, allowing social gatherings of 10 people or less immediately and telling retail businesses that sell goods they can reopen to customers for appointment-only shopping Tuesday.

&gt;That change also allows for non-emergency dental and doctor services to resume next Friday and Whitmer said Thursday that she would continue to relax the order as warranted by the data. She had previously allowed some retail businesses, such as garden stores and bicycle repair shops to reopen, and at 12:01 a.m. Friday, bars, restaurants and other businesses and offices on the Upper Peninsula and in northern Michigan around Traverse City, could open to customers, provided they limited their customers, made sure people stayed six feet apart and required masks.

&gt;Manufacturing and construction have resumed as well, under strict regulations. But many parts of Whitmer's rules — which have been challenged in court [and have been upheld so far btw, funny they don't mention that] and led to protests at the state Capitol — continue to disrupt the lives of Michiganders.

&gt;Large gatherings, for instance, are not allowed, and people must wear masks or other face coverings when in closed spaces. Barber shops and hair salons remain closed, as door sporting and entertainment venues, gyms, casinos and more. Short-term vacation rentals are not allowed. Schools and camps remain closed.

&gt;The extension of the order means all of those rules will remain in place at least until June 12, unless Whitmer decides to relax them before that.

What this means, if you cut through DFP's bullshit, is that far more people are able to go out, to go to work, etc., but the core stay at home order remains. Her shift to ""safer at home"" reflects a shift in policy. Previously ""stay home stay safe"" implied that we should stay home as much as possible. ""Safer at home"" reflects what it says. It's safer to stay home, but we have to go out and about.

Melarsa,"Two different hospitals, same experience in both, both were ""baby friendly"" which means they need a certain percentage of moms to be considered ""successfully"" breastfeeding upon discharge to keep the designation, so they discourage formula and anything else that might ""not promote"" breastfeeding to a crazy degree. Turns out ""baby friendly"" isn't really mom friendly. Nor baby friendly. But hey, breastfeeding #1 at all costs! Woo!

I didn't know anything about it with my first and didn't have another hospital option with my second or else I would have gone non ""baby-friendly."" 

Breastfeeding is a great choice. By all means inform all new mothers about their options during pregnancy and after delivery. 

But witholding any type of safe nutrition from a baby is cruel, and withholding possible negative information about breastfeeding so women aren't able to make informed choices (maybe it's not so great if you have certain viruses that can pass to the baby via breastmilk!) is paternalistic and gross. If it turns out it's safe to breastfeed while sick with Covid-19, great. Let mothers know. If there's any question though, also let them know. It's not discouraging breastfeeding, it's being cautious during a pandemic. 

I'm not the only mom who's experienced some borderline dangerous behavior from baby friendly hospitals promoting breastfeeding at all costs. I don't have anything against breastfeeding (I exclusively pumped with my first for many months because that's how it worked best for us).

I believe its currently illegal in Michigan due to a new executive order to go out without a mask in Mi, could be wrong. 

Maintain mask awareness and let business enforce it, if that doesnt work, get police involved. Right now business can be fined for not adhereing to specific guidlines. 

Also maintain social distancing where able. 

Do those two things and open, i dont see it as a black and white thing, open everything or keep everything closed. But the Gov. Just allowed Travis City to allow gathering and lifted the stay at home order so she could have a grad party for her daughter.

srelma,"&gt;Specifically with 9/11 and Covid, its like comparing apples and oranges, both fruit, both people die, but unless youre going to mark covid as an attack of terror or something similar from China its not worth comparing. 

Why not? Aren't people dying of any reason just as dead and these deaths should be avoided, if possible? If not, why not? 

I don't understand your China comment. Would you suddenly accept the stay at home orders if someone could prove that China released the virus on purpose? If not, then how would you fight the disease differently in that situation? 

Why do you think the US responded to 9/11 the way it did? Wasn't the main reason (at least the one fed to the people) the idea that this way future terror deaths would be avoided? If Patriot Act and the expensive wars in Middle East didn't aim to this, then what was the point of them? 

Can't you see the fight against the pandemic in the same light? People need to make certain sacrifices that help to avoid some deaths in the future. 

&gt;We have 7000 people die per day in the us for every kind of reason.

Which means that the 9/11 deaths wouldn't even register in any excess death graph (if the deaths are collected on a weekly basis as CDC does). However, covid-19 deaths can be easily seen as [excess deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm). 

&gt;So in 4+months covid has killed about as many people as 12 days does.

Yes and instead of whining, you should thank your government for keeping the deaths so low. If your Michigan had the same death rate as New York (which has about 3 times higher), you would have 10 000 more dead people. Is that still not significant? And that despite New York had stay at home orders (a bit too late though). 

&gt;I just dont find it significant enough to warrent the current enforcement

I'd like to see the analysis process how you came to that conclusion. How did you define ""significant"" and what did you compare it to?

&gt;CDC finding covid does NOT transmit easily from surfaces. Which means, wash your hands and wear a mask and youre as safe as you could be.

Is this what CDC is advising the states to do regarding stay at home orders? If not, why do you on one hand trust what CDC says about transmission of the virus, but not what they say, what all that means in practice to what states should do? If you're taking something that the CDC's scientists say as true, but then at the same time dismiss something else they say, isn't that cherry picking? 

Would you be ok, if CDC formulated a phased plan for the states for reopening (including criteria for cases and testing availability) and then states put that in practice? If not, why not? 

&gt;She is making insane grabs for power with her resteictions.

For what? What is the endgame here? How does she (or any other governor) benefit in any way for keeping the state economy closed a single second longer than what's justified by science? I can easily see the argument for governors to reopen too quickly under the political pressure from businesses and people wanting to do things that they are not allowed to do now, but I can't see why would any governor want to keep restrictions in place against the best scientific advice. So, can you walk me through this. Which policies she can implement that she wouldn't be able to implement without the lockdown in place? And I'm talking about permanent changes. Having something in place for another 2 weeks is not going to do anything. Or does she benefit somehow personally from the lockdown? If so, how? I could understand that if she owned a mask making factory then making mask wearing compulsory could pocket her money, but I don't think she does and anyway you're in favour of the mask wearing.",1590186943,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/goicek/the_death_toll_in_sweden_is_catastrophically_high/frhumqc/,safe,2020-05-22

ShinigamiKiba,"We were handling the situation pretty well here in the Balkans, I'm from Macedonia and of course my country has the highest death toll per capita in the region we still handled it fairly well.

However, religious freaks, religious organizations, people refusing to even believe there's a virus out there and business owners not providing safe work conditions were issues we had to deal with throughout the crisis.

Problem is, the Balkans as a whole seems to try to re-open way too soon, Serbia is re-opening their borders soon and unless people show symptoms they're going to be free to come and go as they please. They're ignoring the fact that asymptomatic carries are actually the most dangerous when it comes to spreading the virus.

My country, Macedonia can't do jack to stop religious groups and people from gathering, being a corrupt shithole we have police overlooking blatant law breaking of family gatherings past curfew and such all the time. People don't even wear masks anymore outside, well some do, most do not.

I'm worried that come summer when the Balkans fully re-open we're going become like the US or Italy, all hell is going to break loose and there's nothing we can do about it. Way too many people refuse to even believe the virus is real let alone follow protocols, social distancing, mask wearing.

I'm utterly terrified of what's to come once the balkans fully re open.

It has not had poor results in every single study.

It has had poor results in studies where it has been given to patients with severe symptoms. It is not supposed to be given to people already in hospital, let alone those with severe symptoms.

Like a range of common antiviral treatments, it is supposed to work either as prophylactic prior to infection or within the first few days of infection only.

It’s like putting seatbelts on people who have already had car crashes and saying their lack of recovery is proof seatbelts don’t work!!11! Which is just as patently ridiculous as proclaiming seatbelts cure car crashes. 

They are an extremely common, well-understood family of drugs that have been used billions of times by hundreds of millions of people over the past half a century.

Like any drug, their misuse could be dangerous, but prior to COVID-19, there was no consideration whatsoever of them being anything other than completely routine and safe.

Studies have shown them to be beneficial to subjects if used in the early stages of infection, however, these trials have not been comprehensive or conclusive.  Further testing is underway to establish their effectiveness either way.

pace0008,"They are not literally sacrificing people - thats very unfair to say considering how hard all of us work at hospitals to take care of these patients. 

Its not just about the beds but a huge part of it is the cost. 

 If a patient is medically stable, they have no need to be in the hospital anymore yet they are taking up a bed, you have to pay nurses/aids/therapists etc to take care of them, they are utilizing hospital supplies etc. 

A hospital gets paid by what their diagnosis is -- they get a specific amount no matter how long a patient is there for. So if a patient is medically stable, its costing a lot of money for the hospital to keep a patient there there when there is no need --- thousands of dollars a day per patient. They are already hurting so much financially this is a huge problem. 

Once medically stable, These patients either need to discharge back to their LTC or they need rehab to get better to go home - and the hospital isn't set up for that. They cant provide the needs a patient has to get better, a rehab center is set up for that.

A patient is  COVID positive for weeks and weeks -- meaning if they can't discharge until they are positive its financially devastating, not to mention that there will a shortage of beds- there already are so many discharged delayed/patients ready to discharge but can't that are causing bed shortages. 

There are restrictions in place before a patient can discharge (fever free for 48 hours, etc). But Yes there needs to be a better system to ensure its safe, or have rehabs designated only for covid patients - but dont blame it on the hospitals, thats incredibly unfair.

Initial tests are heavily safety focused. Once you have a few vaccine candidates that are deemed safe in humans, then you start figuring out which ones are effective and eventually you end up with 1 vaccine at the end that is deemed safe and effective for humans. Drug discovery is a long and tedious process. It may not seem to make sense for them to test drugs that they aren't sure are effective, but you don't want to start injecting a bunch of people with something that could kill them which is why safety is the first thing they test for and the most important aspect of any drug they test.",1590194525,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/goks5b/vaccine_for_covid19_safe_effective_in_first_human/fri7poa/,safe,2020-05-22

afreakinchorizo,"It's a catch-22. As a teacher, I can tell you 99% of teachers don't want to go back to school until schools can take the necessary precautions to help keep students and teachers as safe as possible. Obviously, I understand we'll never get that risk down to zero without a vaccine, but there are things we can do to greatly mitigate the risk without a vaccine. The problem is all of these things (more regular cleaning of school, smaller classes, staggered schedules to support social distancing, etc.) cost a lot of money. And because of the economic downturn of the pandemic schools are going to have less money. Since school budgets were already tight and underfunded to begin with and that schools need MORE money to help ensure safety, while they are going to be getting LESS money from the state... I'm just really at a loss as to how we solve this one. 

But ultimately, I agree with you - we need to get back sometime to help protect the learning loss.

Melarsa,"All of which are not necessarily what is safest for mother/baby but hey the optics sure are good!

Baby friendly! Until an exhausted mother accidentally drops her baby because there are no more nurseries.  Baby friendly! Until your baby starves for an unnecessary length of time lest the evil formula be brought out to supplement before it's ""proven"" that things are going pretty fucking poorly. Heaven forbid we just listen to the mothers. What do those stupid bitches know anyway? They aren't even titty certified!

Oh babies do just fine with colostrum only? Fascinating. Tell that to my breasts, which didn't produce mature milk for nearly a week with my first, and didn't produce anything at all with my second. No known health issues. No retained placenta. No thyroid fluctuations. Just no milk for you. 

I'm sure they would have been fine eating almost nothing for over a week. After all, your training tells you lactogenesis 2 happens around day 3, and we all know that the human endocrine system is flawless and never, ever goes against the typical textbook example. I mean sure sometimes breastfeeding fails but like, almost never, right? Best not look into that any further and prepare just in case, I'm sure everything will be fine.

I guess I just did it wrong though. I'm sure the 5 different LCs giving me conflicting advice were all correct, despite that being impossible.

It wasn't my first rodeo with the second, there was no mature milk, no engorgement, no letdown, nothing. My breasts didn't even change during pregnancy. (Although that was true for my first as well.) That familiar burning tingle? Never happened with her. 

She latched (my first never did but I was still able to pump for him although my supply was always lagging behind his demand and it took 4-5 hours a day pumping just to keep said meager supply from tanking.) 

All you genius LCs assured me she was swallowing just fine but when I said I FELT NO MILK and didn't hear the swallowing you patted me on the head and told me of course there was, YOU could hear it. You're the experts, after all. Silly second time mothers, thinking you know anything.

When I insisted on weighed feeds and it became apparent she wasn't getting shit, you all looked so befuddled and then and only then would you begrudgingly hand me the SNS tubes. When pumping resulted in nothing, only then would you resign yourselves to ""allowing"" formula. Fucking morons. How long would you have let her starve? She was already close to needing the bili lights on day 2 and I started begging for help with feeding during golden hour.

I switched to pumping full time with the second baby after we got home to see wtf was happening because that was the method I was most comfortable with. With my son, it took a several days of exclusively pumping at home to bring my mature milk in, but there was always at least some thick yellow colostrum to spoon feed in the meantime. 

But with my daughter I could eke out maybe 2 drops of clear, watery colostrum after each 15-45 minute pump session, 8-12x a day, on day ELEVEN. 

I pumped every 2-3 hours around the clock. I was honking on those tits to manually express every last bit yet there was nothing there but dust. The exact same pump type (new pump though! Fresh motor) exact same methods that worked for my son. Then I changed them up. Tried different hospital grade pumps, different settings, different flanges. Still nada.

Exceptions exist everywhere in nature, especially when it comes to complicated biological systems that rely on hormones where medical scientists STILL aren't in consensus on exactly how they work.

Pretending breastfeeding failure is super duper rare (or only the fault of lazy stupid mothers who aren't trying enough) leads to people NOT BELIEVING WOMEN who know something is wrong. 

Insisting everything is hunky dory leads to dehydrated, jaundiced babies and much worse. ""Oh only a small percentage of women can't produce so don't worry about it."" That is millions of women, you dolts. Millions being told everything is fine and to just keep squeezing blood from a stone while their babies scream in hunger and they slip into darkness because they are told they must be doing something wrong.

Oh and the kid who got pumped milk? Wonderful, smart as a whip, but definitely a late talker and probably has ADHD. Rarely ever sick though. Fucking massive. The one who got nothing but formula? Early talker. Petite. Even stronger immune system if such a thing is possible. No allergies for either.

Wow, it's almost like the primary infant feeding method for the first year or so isn't some all encompassing harbinger of certain outcomes. It's almost like maybe it just doesn't matter that much in the end when all other socio-economic factors are accounted for. It's almost like a lot of the studies on the supposed benefits of breastmilk have maybe been oversold a tad with small study sizes, poor interpretations of the data, and lack of accounting for outside factors.

LCs like you insisted I, the one with the malfunctioning breasts currently experiencing the malfunction, was wrong. You wanted me to starve my babies so you could check off your little charts and get your baby friendly kudos even when it was directly harming my children and myself.

You wanted me to triple feed even if the lack of sleep drove me to PPD, because heaven forbid I ruin my children's precious biomes (they eat fucking dirt and boogers now anyway) and overfill their bellies (which, what? They have off buttons with formula too, you know. They turn their heads when they're full, they don't just drink until they explode) with the dreaded ArTiFiCiAl MiLk that kept them from straight up dying. 

You have 100s of hours of training? Congrats. I stuck my tits in milking machines for countless hours suffering for no reason other than self important fuckheads like you insisting breastmilk was magic and formula would definitely lead to fat, stupid, sickly children so why don't I just keep trying to juggle a neverending feeding routine that meant I would never sleep more than 20 minutes a time until I guess I either died of exhaustion or my tits suddenly started to produce twice as much twice as fast for literally no reason.

I know enough about how MY body reacts to lactation hormones and frequent stimulation for milk to know that some random LC can't be fucking trusted if they'd rather let a baby go hungry than fed at any stage in the game.

The first time around, they didn't immediately know I wasn't producing enough and I didn't know any better so I don't fault them as much. We all learned as we went.

But the second time I warned them that I was slow to produce initially and had trouble with keeping preduction up, and they just ignored me and insisted ""it's easier the second time around!"" It was not. They were wrong. Good thing I was prepared before they convinced me to ""keep trying"" my baby into a dehydration induced coma or worse.

But I'm sure LCs know best. They have that precious training, you see. If a baby goes hungry or gets harmed because they don't realize the mother isn't producing enough milk until it's too late, well at least it's not their baby, am I right? Can't make a breastmilk omelette without cracking a few eggs.

andrewgarrison,"The point of this simulation game is to explore how infections and deaths might be affected by short term efforts to reduce the daily transmission rates of a virus by social distancing and lockdown.

This simulation is based on the [**SIR model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology#The_SIR_model). The compartments used are Suscpetible, Exposed, Infected, Recovering, and Recovered. The Recovering compartment is further broken down into three sub-compartments: Non-Hospitalized, Hospitalized, and Over Capacity. Higher death rates are applied to Over Capacity than Hospitalized and no death rates are applied to Non-Hospitalized.

big_red_meatstick,"&gt; OK. It’s probably not worth while getting into this with you, because you seem to have your head pretty far up the propaganda horses ass

I skimmed your post and you're pretty pathetic when it comes to this issue, so I'm going to tear you one for fun. Likudnik. 

""First, they didn’t turn down aid from Israel. That would’ve been stupid, but they did even better than that.They turn down paid because it came through Israel. It had an Israeli port stamp on it and apparently that contaminated beyond use.""

Nope. It'd be impractical in the short term but, again, you don't get it. It'd be entirely possible for the Palestinians to bring in everything they needed to combat COVID if it wasn't for Israeli policy when it comes to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The sane people of the world agree that it is generally impossible to magically transform ventilators and PPE and emergency medical supplies into weaponry so even under the policies that the Israelis have imposed on the West Bank and Gaza, you would think that there'd be no problem importing said products independently of the Israelis mulling it over and saying ""oh ok but you have to praise our unbridled humanitarianism, you'd be dead if it weren't for us"". 

I understand that you're incapable of processing this but this is what this is about. But you can go back to your little narrative of ""DURR PALESTINIANS WOULD RATHER GET COVID"" or whatever your game is. 

""Second, pretending that this is all about the “occupation” is also stupid. It landed at the airport. Israel would exist with or without Gaza and the West Bank. So would the airport.""

Putting the words occupation in quotes is cute, I guess. But the fact remains that Palestinians cannot import and export properly because of the occupation, which is to say the hostile military occupation of what's left of their country. If Israel did the right thing regarding the Palestinians for once in its existence and ended the occupation, the Palestinians could bring their own medical supplies in. See how simple it all is?

""Finally, your approach here is one that leaves Palestine blameless. If that is truly what you think, you are massively deluded. Palestine remains dedicated to the eradication of Israel. The fact that they are run by a terrorist group and continue a guerrilla bombing campaign just supports that. With negotiations repeatedly fall apart because one side won’t except that the other will exist at the end of negotiations, it kind of puts a damper on the talks.""

You must have worms in your brain, for real. Whine more about me ""bullying Israel"" when I'm looking at 53 years of illegal military occupation plus the garbage Likud party ordering the annexation of 33% of the West Bank wholesale by July. But, yeah, I'll play.

1. Israel was founded on land theft from Palestinians and the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. People who owned 6% of the land in Mandate Palestine don't deserve 55%, and that's going on the partition plan before the war.

2. Israel was founded by paramilitary organizations that were considered ""terrorist"" by the British and others, and the founding militias in this case sowed more terror against the Palestinian people than Hamas ever has against Israelis. Also, Hamas only controls Gaza, not the totality of the nascent Palestinian state. Also, even people in the IDF and the Mossad have sounded off against the blacklisting of Hamas and have stressed the need to engage them seriously as opposed to treating them as Hitler 2.0. 

3. Eli Valley has a good cartoon making fun of people like you. Barring the fact that ""guerilla bombings"" during the intifadas often targeted the Israeli army or Israeli police, the ""guerilla bombing campaign"" was in general in response to the conduct of the Israeli army and the Israeli government. So rightly or wrongly, it happened for a reason-- and more importantly, occured well over a decade ago. But keep talking about Hamas bombings from 2004 when we're living in 2020.

4. In actuality, when one side (the Israelis, since you come across as a lil slow) constantly makes unreasonable, hypocritical demands during the ""negotiations"" that only ever put the onus on the Palestinians to give everything up and accept everything Israel demands they do-- then you don't have ""talks"", you have a diktat. Asking Israel to end the occupation and remove all ""settlements"" isn't remotely a ""painful concession""; it's common sense in regards to forming a 2-state solution that actually works.

But that ship has sailed with the Israeli rejection of the Arab Peace Initiative. Now you're the one acting like a jackass when Israel is on the cusp of becoming an apartheid state across the board and sparking the 3rd intifada with this annexation plan.

AgentOrcish,"There will be a collapse of civil services if the economy gets worse. Local and state economies are not getting tax revenue. They are under water. Less tax revenue leads to layoffs in court systems, fire companies, police departments, utility workers, judges, teachers, school administrators. 
Most schools are going to ask teachers to take less pay next year. The teacher Unions are already getting ready for a fight. I know for a fact the most schools are facing budget deficits in the millions starting July 1, 2020. 

That leads to discussions of what to cut... arts? Sports? Band? Parents are going to lose their shit if they don’t get their Friday night Lights! I know this may sound silly, but high school football and sports in general will be a huge sense of normalcy in the Fall. Without it, communities will be depressed. I was. Ever a fan, but as someone who gets dragged to the games, I now can respect what a Friday night game does for the community. 

Parents are complaining about educating their kids...I have news for them, if teachers have to take less pay and strike, you’ll be teaching your kids full time in the Fall. They will be home with you. The CDC regulations over education and schools did not take in mind the schools budget deficits and teacher unions. Those two obstacles are going to throw a giant wrench in those plans. 

If cops get laid off, you better arm your household because the unemployed and hungry will come to your house. State unemployment systems were not made to withstand the amount of claims that they are seeing now. There will eventually be no money to give. 

Weaker corporations are going under. Hertz, JC Penney, Friendly’s, Ruby Tuesday... this starts a ripple effect because those employees lost those jobs for good. They are not coming into work after this is over. Those jobs are gone. 

That also means less people paying for healthcare, less people able to pay rent for a long time, not just a short period. 

Deflation will kick in. Things will be worth less, but some items will be worth more.

If the US did nothing but try to manage Hotspot and let everyone do what they wanted then the pee capita deaths and hospitalizations would skyrocket and the health care system would have collapsed. An earlier lock down in the US would have softened the blow more and allowed for earlier reopenings.

JAJ_reddit,"
&gt;You say this but provide no rational for your assertion. There are many ways they could prevent Bots. ID requirement is one. But there are many more. You are just being overly assertive of your opinion.

The rational is that in order to combat something like botting you would have to have a full team ready to constantly be changing how you address this issue 24/7, no company can do that. Even if a law was put into place forcing Facebook to fight botting with everything they had they would go bankrupt before fixing that issue. Because it's a constantly evolving problem that gets more and more advanced everytime you do something to stop it. 

Also, ID requirements actually does nothing to stop botting at all and would just encourage bad actors to steal peoples accounts and post stuff under their names. If you can't create accounts, then taking already made ones is the next logical step. 

What are these many more solutions to this problem that no one has solved yet? 


&gt; This is a much larger and more pressing issue than games. That is not a good analogy and doesn't apply here

How is comparing two online sectors that have issues with botting not apply here? Obviously, botting video games is not as serious as social media manipulation bots, no one said that. You are misunderstanding the reason I pointed out video games. Which is that, billion dollar companies run these video games and they struggle constantly with dealing with bots with little to no success. The consequences for the video game players has nothing to do with this point. And companies dealing with bots is 100% applicable to this conversation because it's about what to do to bots.  

&gt; Let me put it this way. 100,00 Americans have died as a result of this virus and Bots are spreading dangerous misinformation that surely has caused death. Sure it sucks when you get wallhacked and headshotted. But you can just respawn. It doesn't equate. Get it?

You are strawmanning my argument, that paragraph you quoted has nothing to do with wallhacking or getting headshot. It doesn't equate video game hacks to propaganda bots. It's literally just explaining how bot makers will always be right there ready to alter their bots to keep working even when the company is actively trying to stop them. You took a paragraph about why bots are a problem to fix and tried to turn it into complaining about cheaters in video games... 

&gt; So you whole argument boils down to ""they haven't fixed it so it impossible""?

No, and again you are strawmanning my argument. My argument isn't they haven't fixed it so it's impossible, it's that they can't fix it because it's impossible to stop something that is constantly updating to workaround your fixes. You called my post out as simplistic and you don't even have a basic understanding of how these things work. This isn't a crack in the wall that you can just plaster over and jobs done. The enemy here would be a group of people (usually multiple groups) that's constantly working to get around any blockade you throw up to stop them. 

I use video games as an example because that is an industry that has struggled with dealing with these same issues for years and years and has not been successful. Because of the reasons I listed above, combating this problem is way more complicated than you seem to be making it out to be. Because the hackers have always found ways around anything these multi billion dollar companies have implemented. 

&gt;People are always trying to find new ways to commit crimes. That doesn't mean it's impossible to stop them. This situation is too important to throw our hands up and say ""It's Impossible!""

This situation is important but you are misunderstanding my response. It's not that we should do nothing about this issue or that because it's too hard we should give up. It's that banning bots is not the best solution to this problem. Because when you ban a bot the creator knows they got caught and works to hide it better.",1590282869,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gosh6e/carnegie_mellon_university_researchers_have/frlrjrg/,game,2020-05-23

ProdigalSon123456,"&gt; That's the issue, is my lack of clarity on actual policy

That's the case for a lot of people, and I think it's because fictional portrayals of American police make them out to be ""the good guys who risk their lives to save all lives"". I've seen far too many movies where the bad guy pulls out a gun on the officer and the officer pulls out his own and orders the bad guy to drop it. Truth be told, the moment an officer sees a person brandishing anything that could be a weapon, lethal force is technically authorized and that person would have died in a hail of bullets.

Coming from another country, if you are ever stopped by American police, be polite and don't give any reason for an officer to be stressed out/raise their voice. Keep your hands visible at all times, never reach for anything in your pockets or in a vehicle unless ordered, never walk away from an officer with your back turned, and never walk toward police unless directed. Basically, pretend that the whole ordeal is a game of ""Simon Says"", and it will be fine.

If you feel that you are being unlawfully arrested, that's a matter to be decided between the law enforcement agency, your attorney, and embassy/consulate. Don't ever try to resist arrest.

1) Flatten the curve, keep the healthcare system from being overrun
2) Protect the elderly, prevent it from reaching them

One succeeded, one failed. Pretending 2 wasn’t a goal is not being honest and the expert authority openly admits that they failed there. 

WHY they failed is much more complicated then lockdown or no lockdown. Sweden was one of the first Scandinavian countries to recommend the elderly to isolate and to ban visits from elderly homes, a week to a month ahead of the others. The voluntary social distancing methods have, according to the data, worked just as well as the mandatory rules in Denmark - same reduction in travel, reduced consumption etc. 

And, importantly, the epidemic didn’t develope the same way everywhere - it exploded Stockholm. Malmö and Scania are doing just as well of not better then Denmark per capita, despite drastically different rules (at first at least - Denmark now has the same rules). 

And here is where a crucial bit of context comes in - I think the mistakes came early on and had nothing to do with having a lockdown or not. Thousands of families with kids went on vacation  during spring break in week 9 from Stockholm to the alps and Italy - Malmö had theirs week 8. A massive concert was held in Friends Arena in early March for the Swedish Eurovision event. Stockholm’s elder care is fully privatized with the highest levels of hourly paid employees that cannot afford to be home sick and have limited training, while Malmö has publicly run elder care facilities with one of the lowest rates of hourly labour and highest rates of educated personnel in the country. 

All these factors made the epidemic a bomb in Stockholm, but not in Malmö - despite the exact same rules.

On January 24th one infected person who wasn't showing symptoms yet went into a restaurant (A1 in the picture) to have dinner with friends.  They were in the restaurant for about an hour and a half.  They ate dinner with approximately 30 other people, sitting in the estimated positions of the diagram.  9 of those 30 got infected by this event.

The diagram shows the airflow from the air conditioner and the people who got infected by the person.  3 of the 4 people at the table in the direction of the air flow were infected, as were the two people at A1's table sitting right next to them.

skepticaleconomist,"Nah fam, the propaganda is the narrative people blindly accept that your PPE is working as well as you believe it is. First of all, is there still a shortage? Last I checked, national surveys (NPR reports) had nurses reporting they were still experiencing—and paying the price for—a PPE shortage. Your homemade mask cannot do what it needs to replace strict physical distancing and sanitation rules. 


Contrary to the break-through hamster study, the research and scientific consensus is that cloth masks are insufficient at filtering micro particles— masks that the N95 can do to safely protect the wearer from disease transmission.


My frustration comes from the apparent relaxation of physical distancing norms as the popular conversations center around masks. I truly believe that people are far too uncomfortable with the prospects of changing their behavior to accommodate a new set of public health standards that would be necessary to keep people safe during an outbreak without a vaccine.


This means that if people can latch onto a narrative that uses masks as the proxy for the necessary behavior change in a post-pandemic world, then they’re willing to overlook the existing scientific evidence and instead use social pressuring tactics to convince a large majority to buy into the idea that masks are enough. 


There’s subtlety to arguments and discussion about what our social and economic behavior is going be during and after this global event. I think the mob mentality of mask-wearing plays into the same issues that make us susceptible to misinformation. 


In a lot of ways the mask debate is common sense vs science. Common sense tells us if we cover our mouth, we can prevent the spread of disease. Science tells us this same thing. However, this diverges when Common Sense delves into the fields of microbiology/epidemiology. All of a sudden, Common Sense needs to stand up to fact,  experimentation, and scrutiny. 

Further, in these advanced fields, complexity arises to which your Common Sense can’t necessarily capture with the simple act of wearing a mask. An example of a complexity that fails under a Common Sense answer of “just wear a mask” is when people use this to justify reducing the social distancing requirements. This behavior arises from a cost-reduction incentive of the individual or firm to minimize the energy requirement for sustained behavioral change. Without systemic and structural changes, the costs to interact safely relies on our behavior. 

Can you get a haircut from six feet away? No? Well then a mask should do the trick—right?

Never mind that the public health guidance circa Trump was strict physical distancing + sanitation, forget the shortage of surgical masks and the PPE desperately needed by our country’s healthcare workers, and let’s use Common Sense to overlook the fact that cloth masks have yet to prove their marginal benefit.


What I’ve been advocating (re: spamming) these forums with a conversation I think is worth having. Shouldn’t we employ critical thinking during this age of information—even to the mob mentality of mask wearers?

Numerous new cases of corona after service in Frankfurt

Surrounding districts also affected by corona infections

Church services are permitted again in Hesse

Frankfurt - At a service of the Evangelical Christian Baptist Church in Frankfurt, a large number of people were infected with Corona. Believers from the entire Rhine-Main area are affected. This was confirmed to the Frankfurter Rundschau by Antoni Walczok, deputy director of the Frankfurt Health Office. ""This is a very dynamic event."" He couldn't say how many people are sick or infected. The country has been informed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The outbreak did not only affect Frankfurt, but also surrounding districts to a greater or lesser extent, such as the Wetterau, Hochtaunus, and Main-Kinzig districts. According to the Main-Kinzig-Kreis, 16 people in Hanau alone tested positive and were assigned to the cluster.

&amp;#x200B;

Corona crisis in Frankfurt: church services allowed again

The prayer house of the Evangelical Christian Baptist congregation is located at Eschborner Landstraße 99-101 in Frankfurt. The service was celebrated there on Sunday, 10 May, during which the believers are said to have been infected. Association chairman Eugen Steiger is in hospital, his daughter told the FR on the phone. Afterwards a woman's voice intervened: ""We don't have to give you an answer"" - and ended the conversation abruptly.

&amp;#x200B;

In doing so, the community did not do anything illegal. On May 10, church services were allowed again in Hesse, Walczok said. Unlike in the catering industry, for example, registration of visitors with their names and addresses was not mandatory. The rules of distance and hygiene must be observed. There are no guidelines regarding the number of participants. ""There was no violation of a legal ordinance,"" the deputy head of the office makes clear.

&amp;#x200B;

Corona in Frankfurt: Churches must develop their own concept

The lack of a registration requirement makes the work of the competent health authorities difficult. They now have the task of locating possible contact persons and ordering quarantine - or isolation for those who are less seriously ill.

&amp;#x200B;

Following the update of the regulations on the Corona crisis, religious communities have been allowed to reassemble since 1 May. To this end, churches and religious communities must develop their own concept for maintaining the rules of distance, hygiene and access control and coordinate it with the Länder and the Robert Koch Institute. 

&amp;#x200B;

Corona in Frankfurt: Individual event can have fatal consequences

A minimum distance of 1.5 metres must be maintained between persons who do not live together in the same household. Objects such as the collection basket may not be passed on. ""Hygienic measures such as the placement of disinfectant dispensers must be ensured"", says the corresponding communication from the state government.

&amp;#x200B;

On Friday (22.05.2020) Main-Kinzig District Administrator Thorsten Stolz and Health Department Head Susanne Simmler (both SPD) appealed to the population not to become careless. ""As this outbreak in Frankfurt shows, a single event with a large number of different contacts can have far-reaching consequences for the incidence of infection"". The public health authorities concerned would now have their hands full with explaining as many infection routes as possible and thus preventing further infections.

lobax,"Copenhagen had their vacation week 7, Stockholm week 9. That does a massive difference, because the spread of the virus is exponential.   


Copenhagen was actually ahead of Stockholm in the beginning (with a similar curve as Gothenburg, that had their spring break at the same time), but the growth of the curve was never even remotely as bad as it became in Stockholm for either of these because fewer percentages of those abroad became sick when they came home.   


Reductions in travel happened just as drastically in Sweden, with voluntary meassures (although Denmark never had internal lockdown like Italy or Finland - like Sweden that was encouraged through voluntary requests). I work for a company that provides financial services to SJ, the national train service, and we saw a 90% reduction in revenue from train travel.   


The thing that probably made the largest difference was not the ""lockdown"" (Denmark never locked down per se either, at least not compared to the rest of the world), but that Denmark banned large gatherings much earlier then Sweden. Sweden still held the Eurovision event and football games, and did the 50 people limit too late i think.

Warrior_Runding,"&gt;It just states that there are 74,000 international deaths above the normal amount for that period. If they're not tested for COVID and have no symptoms, we can't just assume they're COVID without evidence.

We can't *not* assume they aren't Covid deaths either as a non-zero result of testing those bodies would mean that we are underreporting. This is where politics has been intersecting with science and leading to very conservative policies such as not counting people who ""probably"" had Covid but were not tested for a variety of reasons as well as just plain not testing the dead. You are relying on very decontextualized numbers and not prefacing your opinions with the reality that the politics of this pandemic are interfering with accurately gauging this event.

&gt;I would bet a lot of those heart attack deaths are the results of stress caused by the coverage of the virus but I wouldn't state this as scientific fact as I have no evidence.

This is indeed possible but because testing isn't being done, due to political expediency in many cases, we won't know and we can't assume the numbers we are using are accurate.

&gt;Where are the reports of people becoming reinfected? As far as I'm aware these have all been debunked.

Here is the most recent [case](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/16/857379338/5-uss-roosevelt-sailors-test-positive-for-covid-19-again) of reported reinfection. As I said, those cases for reinfection show that the testing procedures or the tests themselves failed, which is the best case scenario, and reinfection is possible, at worst case. 

As for antibody numbers, we still don't know if that guarantees or confers any sort of long term immunity. It has been just too soon to speak with any certainty. As well, the credibility of the science WHO is conducting is certainly up for question as, as far as I know, they are using numbers supplied from China which are most certainly a fabrication given the regime's history of downplaying, erasing, and misrepresenting events and figures.

But again, the reason why you are being downvoted is because you are speaking with certainty in a manner that comes off as downplaying the severity of this pandemic, especially since your comments are devoid of contextualization, prefacing, and acknowledgement that these are best case scenario figures, which we most certainly aren't in.

Pablois4,"&gt; Yup. 9/11 shocked the country to the bone, but it wasn't really about the scale of the deaths. 

IMHO, a huge part of the shock is that we witnessed it - the 2nd plane crashing, people desperately leaning out windows and if the fire was too bad, jumping, the buildings coming down.  The way people died was horrifying - not just the jumpers, but the folks in the planes who knew they were being hijacked and flying right over, very close to the Manhattan buildings, the folks in the plane that crashed in PA, the badly burned folks in the pentagon.  

Or an alternate event that shocked the nation - the Boston Marathon bombings.  That only killed 4 people but again, we saw horrifying images - in particular the guy with his lower legs blown off and the medic holding onto a key artery to keep him from bleeding out.  As well, the idea of having your legs blown off is particularly disturbing.  

And then lets compare the images of this pandemic.   We seen folks laying quietly in hospital beds, refrigerated trucks, worried nurses &amp; doctors. None of those things are particularly novel or scary.   We've seen no huge sweeping, dramatic actions.  All the terrible stuff - the folks struggling to breath, the ones dying - has been reported and not seen.

keelhaulrose,"When there's a plane crash or 9/11 event we spend days hearing about timelines and concerns someone had, and there's always pictures of the dead with blurbs about their lives. They often get a memorial at the site with the names on it.

Could you imagine trying to read 3,000 blurbs a day? Just death after death. It would be absolutely depressing.

I think many people took it more seriously a couple months ago when we were having those horrific visuals leak: glimpses of crowded hospitals with people dying in the hallways, nurses holding up battered, inadequate PPE, and refrigerated trucks parked outside hospitals for bodies.

But think about it, have we seen that sort of thing recently? No, and the bigger problem when it comes to getting people to care in the US is we're seeing signs that the worst-case scenario we planned for was avoided. Makeshift hospitals that never got close to capacity are being dismantled, the USS Comfort leaving New York, we never see those body trucks filled. I remember early on a graph/meme going around that showed the curve examples that said ""if we do it right it's going to look like we overreacted"".

And therein lies the problem: for the vast majority of the country it looked like we overreacted. The national media focused on New York and left the local stuff to the locals, which is a problem when more people are getting their news online. It seemed like a New York problem and because New York was simultaneously hard hit and competently run it appears, by outside observer standard, that they overreacted (Trump doesn't help this narrative when he talks about things like the Comfort leaving as though it wasn't used at all). It's only recently that the national news have started shifting to hot spots outside New York, but the damage is past done. It was a New York problem so long that people didn't see it in their own communities even though it was there.

We also have the problem in this country that we are insanely politically divided, and our leaders couldn't put their differences aside long enough to lead. Somehow not spreading a deadly disease became a political thing (""liberals want to be pussies and have us all wear masks and cower at home!"" ""conservatives are idiots who want to kill grandma for the economy!"") I could go into a very long rant about how capitalism fucked us further, but other people have put that much better than I.

It was a perfect storm of a populace with an ""us vs them"" divide that's only grown recently, the vast majority of people who aren't able to financially survive a shutdown, an economic system that relies on people overworking, a fractured government, a President who downplayed things and can't pick a lane forhos response, and the national media doing what they usually do- focus on New York until it's worse somewhere else. There are many other smaller factors, but there really is no fixing this. The only way the narrative changes is that the most vocal voices for opening back up getting first hand experience either getting it themselves or losing someone they love and, even then, at this point the person they lose who they loved almost needs to be someone not in the risk category.",1590244160,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/govg1u/the_us_has_had_the_equivalent_of_12_plane_crashes/frjvr2t/,event,2020-05-23

neversaydie_,"Wrong. 

You’re trying to compare oranges to apples. 

We’re talking about a global event, not just “people traveling before”. 

Chinese New Year’s is a huge event for China. If the Pandemic did start in China, and then they let it marinate for 1-2 months and then started all traveling near end of January, it’s similar to OP’s topic. 

An Event, that could have been avoided or lockdown faster, did not.

Therefore, cases that could have been avoided are now the ones that have affected hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people. 

Don’t compare oranges to apples. You’re barely even on the same page. This is about Chinese New Year. And What China did in that time.


TL;DR

So you’re saying Chinese New Year is equal to that of people traveling during some random week time period in Early November or October 2019? 
Nope, Not even close. You’re wrong. 
And yes, Chinese New Year is a period of a week(s), give or take. 

You’re comparing MONTHS to a very small period of time where millions are hitting the airports and flying everywhere across the world simultaneously IN DAYS. NOT just months before “Chinese New Year”, where air traffick isn’t even close to how it is during Chinese New Year IN THAT WEEK.

Giles-TheLibrarian,"&gt; [The Trump administration] have tainted the notion that the outbreak began with a lab accident or safety breach.

&gt; “**An open investigation is absolutely warranted and absolutely essential,” said Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University**. A longtime biosafety proponent, Ebright believes that a **lab error is “at least as probable” as an entirely natural spillover event.** “Unsupported claims by Trump and Pompeo have politicized and polarized the issue and likely have had the effect of making an open investigation less likely.”

&gt; **We need to look wider than just the wet market origin,” said Filippa Lentzos, a biosafety expert at King’s College London. “At the moment it’s still an open question**.” The closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2 is a bat coronavirus that was sampled by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but the two viruses are not close enough to suggest a direct link.

&gt; In order to determine what happened, these experts say, the world needs a neutral inquiry untainted by the Trump administration’s efforts to divert attention away from the botched U.S. response. “**The investigation shouldn’t be about apportioning blame,” said Lentzos. “The investigation needs to be about finding a credible answer for how the pandemic started** and then using that to develop an early warning for the future

&gt; If a full investigation is eventually conducted, biosafety experts hope that it will include a review of samples and safety protocols from the Wuhan labs as well as the wet market. Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, said it would be useful to see lab records from Wuhan going back to August, as well as any records from work with other mammalian viruses.

&gt; If it was a breach, we need to know, because then clearly we are overestimating our capacities to contain some of these viruses,” he said. “We need to know this as scientists because if it can infect one scientist then it can infect a third, fourth, fifth.”",1590286678,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gozhad/the_trump_administration_is_thwarting/frlxnde/,event,2020-05-23

Trimdon73,"From what I've heard and read I think you're wide of the mark in terms of: ""the majority of people believe the number of Covid deaths is the only thing that matters in society"", certainly here in England anyway. The difference with the United States as far as I understand it is that there is little welfare provision, and as a result you have untold numbers of people relying on food banks and the like and many will lose their homes. That's a completely different situation and I understand why people in a huge state with a sparse population and low numbers of infections would wish to take their chances: I would be in that group. What's needed is reason and pragmatism, as opposed to panic and political ideology.

There is absolutely no doubt that there will be serious upheaval in the short term, but just as I'd caution against panic from those wanting the country to stay locked down until it's eradicated, I'd also caution against panic from those who believe the economy will never recover. We had two world wars not too long ago with upwards of 10 million people losing their lives and severe dislocation of economies: these economies recovered.

It follows that a balance has to be found. Do you have the number of infections to a point where social distancing should keep the rate of infection to a manageable level? Do you have the equipment to support that? What we're really talking about here is sacrificing some of the most vulnerable so that the rest of society can go about their lives as normal: is this morally acceptable and what far reaching consequences would this have for your society? And, in the event you don't have this thing down to a manageable level there is a genuine prospect of hospitals being overwhelmed and various illnesses going untreated. At the same time, is it fair to expect people to give up their livelihoods, with families and bills to pay, so that a small segment of our society is protected?

I think the balance is that those people who have given up their livelihoods have done their fair share and there needs to be a mechanism to get these people back into work, but at the same time we simply do not have the infection levels down to a number where we can afford to live our lives as normal and there's a very real prospect that in the event we do such a thing we'll back where we started in a couple of months time. Here in England it has to be slowly and surely, and see how it goes. Unfortunately, many jobs simply can't be saved whether or not a lockdown is in place, for example travel companies, because too many people are not prepared to go through an airport and sit on a plane.

It even got to the point where there were massive demonstrations (women's day) and group events (Vox party event) going on while the country had thousands of confirmed cases. 

Below I paste a comment I made in another thread that gives detailed info. I'm comparing with Greece because it's a very similar country to Spain. There have been much more successful countries (like say Slovakia).

The large religious gatherings reflect the conflict between Pakistan’s powerful imams, who successfully lobbied the government last month to allow congregational prayers, and health officials, who warn that the country’s fragile health system could be overwhelmed if current trends continue.

The number of coronavirus cases in this country of 230 million has quadrupled in the past month, jumping from 12,000 to over 48,000. And the rate of new infections is steadily rising: The number of cases increased 30 percent in just the past week. More than 1,000 people have died.

Yet the country’s Supreme Court ruled Monday that the coronavirus “apparently is not a pandemic in Pakistan,” and government officials, including Prime Minister Imran Khan, have suggested that the economic costs of prolonged restrictions outweigh the health costs of increased infection. The same influential religious leaders who called for the easing of restrictions for Ramadan are now demanding they be done away with completely for Eid, a holiday that marks the end of the holy month.

On a recent visit to the Jamia Mosque in Rawalpindi, the number of worshipers was significantly smaller than a normal Friday turnout, but none of the government guidelines — social distancing, mandatory use of face masks and the elimination of prayer mats — were strictly enforced.

Many of those who came to pray said they believed God would protect them from infection inside a house of worship. Others said the global pandemic made it more important for Muslims to attend mosque.

“This is a punishment from God, and we must ask his forgiveness,” said Raja Nasib Ali, a 46-year-old businessman wearing a surgical mask over a long beard dyed with henna.

Naveed Paracha, a 35-year-old employee of a garment shop, said he came to the mosque because he feels his faith is stronger than any virus. “Diseases come and go, but for Muslims, you always have to stand in front of God,” he said.",1590201152,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gox2au/pakistans_coronavirus_cases_quadruple_during_the/friia5l/,attend,2020-05-22

exmoor456,"My junior and senior years in high school were 1968 and 1969; five decades later, I can still remember some of the main events of that era: the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy, the bombing of Cambodia, the Apollo 8 spaceflight that orbited the moon, and Woodstock, which I pleaded with my parents to let me attend. (They said no.)

In my personal life, I remember playing on the basketball team, buying my first car, working in my family’s corner grocery store and wishing I had the nerve to ask certain girls out on a date. Here’s what I don’t remember: the pandemic of 1968-1969.

And yet there was one. It was called the H3N2 virus — less formally, the Hong Kong flu — and it took a significant toll. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that 1 million people died worldwide, 100,000 in the U.S. Conditions in large U.S. cities sound similar to what they’re going through now, with overwhelmed hospital workers, millions of people getting sick and the elderly most likely to die.

When I first read about this pandemic, I could scarcely believe I had missed it. According to a recent article in the Wall Street Journal, the virus wreaked havoc in Europe, with French manufacturers suffering severe disruptions and West German garbage collectors burying the dead because there weren’t enough undertakers. In the U.S., the New York Times reported, the Citadel had to suspend classes because 165 cadets came down with the virus. Absenteeism in Los Angeles schools rose as high as 25%. In Boston, where I would soon be headed to college, university infirmaries were said to be filled with ill students. Tallulah Bankhead was a prominent victim of the virus.

A quick search confirms that the Times 1 had covered the pandemic at the time. But I didn’t read the Times when I was in high school, and even if I had, I might well have missed the coverage. Every article was buried well inside the paper.

I did read the Boston Globe, but it wasn’t exactly trumpeting the news either. I found a humor piece by Art Buchwald (“For pretty young ladies, the HKF can be your protection from drunken bosses at Christmas parties”). The news that the virus was officially an epidemic ran in a short wire-service article on Page 5. On New Year’s Eve, the Globe predicted that the flu might keep people indoors. Or maybe not: “Flu or not, there are many who won’t let anything stand in the way of celebrating the holiday.”

From our current perspective, with shelter-in-place rules in much of the country, the most striking thing about the contemporaneous accounts was the absence of any discussion of lockdowns or even social distancing. I saw a few photos of nurses and office workers wearing masks, but that apparently wasn’t mandated either.

Even the occasional school closings were one-offs; not a single state ordered that schools or businesses be closed en masse. The virus swept across the world, causing tens of millions of people to become sick — and killing nearly three times the number of people who have died so far of Covid-19 — and the world’s chief mitigation effort was to race to make a vaccine. By the time one was ready, the pandemic had largely fizzled out.

This pandemic, of course, will be indelibly seared in the memory of those who lived through it. It is the biggest story since 9/11, with the ever-rising number of cases and deaths dominating the news. Children who are now wearing masks, doing schoolwork online and staying indoors will never forget it.

They’ll also no doubt remember the economic aftermath, which is likely to be horrific, with deflation and even a depression a possibility. On Tuesday, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that “there is a risk of permanent damage” to the economy if the country remained locked down much longer.

All of which raises a question that has so far been relegated to a small handful of coronavirus contrarians: with all the businesses that are going to fail, and the tens of millions of people who will be unemployed — and the other negative consequences that come with forcing people to stay at home — will the lockdown have been worth it? Or would we have been better off doing something closer to what the country did in 1968 — yes, taking precautions like wearing masks, washing hands and protecting the elderly, but allowing businesses and schools to stay open while people went about their lives?

There are two issues here. The first is that quarantining an entire population is not some set-in-stone technique that has been used for decades to stem the spread of a virus. It was first proposed in 2006 by two government doctors — neither of them infectious disease specialists — after President George W. Bush asked for a plan to combat pandemics.

Soon afterward, a paper was published calling for a national policy of sheltering-in-place. It swayed Bush. But four scientists who were infectious disease specialists also wrote a paper about the idea — a devastating critique. There was no science to support the notion that a national quarantine would halt the spread of infection, they wrote. It could increase the risk of infection for people living in close quarters. Closing theaters, malls, restaurants, stores and bars — not to mention church services and athletic events — would have “serious disruptive consequences.” Closing schools was not only impractical “but carries the possibility of a seriously adverse outcome.” And so on.

The scientists concluded:

Experience has shown that communities faced with epidemics or other adverse events respond best and with the least anxiety when the normal social functioning of the community is least disrupted. Strong political and public health leadership to provide reassurance and to ensure that needed medical care services are provided are critical elements. If either is seen to be less than optimal, a manageable epidemic could move toward catastrophe.

The second issue is that there is surprisingly little evidence that lockdowns work. Last week, a statistician named William M. Briggs, who is solidly in the anti-lockdown camp, wrote a blog post comparing countries that locked down with countries that didn’t. As of May 12, the U.S. had 237 deaths per million people. Taiwan, a no-lockdown country, had 0.3 deaths per million. (The country has had a total of seven deaths.)

No-lockdown Sweden has had 347 deaths per million; lockdown Belgium, with a similar population, has had 763 deaths per million. Ethiopia, with a population of 109 million, had no lockdown — and a death rate of 0.04 per million.

“Death rates were more than highly variable; they were all over the place,” Briggs wrote of the data he had collected. “If lockdowns worked as advertised, we would not see such enormous variability in the death rates.”

“What should we conclude?” he added. “Strike that. What can we conclude? Only one thing: We cannot conclude that lockdowns worked.”

Let me point out one other fact about the pandemic of the late 1960s. Like many coronaviruses, the H3N2 virus came in waves. The last one began in the fall of 1969 and ended in early 1970. Assuming this coronavirus fades in the summer, there is a high likelihood that it will return with a vengeance in the fall and winter. If that happens, are you truly ready to lock down again?

In my personal life, I remember playing on the basketball team, buying my first car, working in my family’s corner grocery store and wishing I had the nerve to ask certain girls out on a date. Here’s what I don’t remember: the pandemic of 1968-1969.

And yet there was one. It was called the H3N2 virus — less formally, the Hong Kong flu — and it took a significant toll. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that 1 million people died worldwide, 100,000 in the U.S. Conditions in large U.S. cities sound similar to what they’re going through now, with overwhelmed hospital workers, millions of people getting sick and the elderly most likely to die.


When I first read about this pandemic, I could scarcely believe I had missed it. According to a recent article in the Wall Street Journal, the virus wreaked havoc in Europe, with French manufacturers suffering severe disruptions and West German garbage collectors burying the dead because there weren’t enough undertakers. In the U.S., the New York Times reported, the Citadel had to suspend classes because 165 cadets came down with the virus. Absenteeism in Los Angeles schools rose as high as 25%. In Boston, where I would soon be headed to college, university infirmaries were said to be filled with ill students. Tallulah Bankhead was a prominent victim of the virus.

A quick search confirms that the Times 1   had covered the pandemic at the time. But I didn’t read the Times when I was in high school, and even if I had, I might well have missed the coverage. Every article was buried well inside the paper.

I did read the Boston Globe, but it wasn’t exactly trumpeting the news either. I found a humor piece by Art Buchwald (“For pretty young ladies, the HKF can be your protection from drunken bosses at Christmas parties”). The news that the virus was officially an epidemic ran in a short wire-service article on Page 5. On New Year’s Eve, the Globe predicted that the flu might keep people indoors. Or maybe not: “Flu or not, there are many who won’t let anything stand in the way of celebrating the holiday.”

From our current perspective, with shelter-in-place rules in much of the country, the most striking thing about the contemporaneous accounts was the absence of any discussion of lockdowns or even social distancing. I saw a few photos of nurses and office workers wearing masks, but that apparently wasn’t mandated either.

Even the occasional school closings were one-offs; not a single state ordered that schools or businesses be closed en masse. The virus swept across the world, causing tens of millions of people to become sick — and killing nearly three times the number of people who have died so far of Covid-19 — and the world’s chief  mitigation effort was to race to make a vaccine. By the time one was ready, the pandemic had largely fizzled out.


This pandemic, of course, will be indelibly seared in the memory of those who lived through it. It is the biggest story since 9/11, with the ever-rising number of cases and deaths dominating the news. Children who are now wearing masks, doing schoolwork online and staying indoors will never forget it.

They’ll also no doubt remember the economic aftermath, which is likely to be horrific, with deflation and even a depression a possibility. On Tuesday, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that “there is a risk of permanent damage” to the economy if the country remained locked down much longer.

All of which raises a question that has so far been relegated to a small handful of coronavirus contrarians: with all the businesses that are going to fail, and the tens of millions of people who will be unemployed — and the other negative consequences that come with forcing people to stay at home — will the lockdown have been worth it? Or would we have been better off doing something closer to what the country did in 1968 — yes, taking precautions like wearing masks, washing hands and protecting the elderly, but allowing businesses and schools to stay open while people went about their lives?

There are two issues here. The first is that quarantining an entire population is not some set-in-stone technique that has been used for decades to stem the spread of a virus. It was first proposed in 2006 by two government doctors — neither of them infectious disease specialists —  after President George W. Bush asked for a plan to combat pandemics.

Soon afterward, a paper was published calling for a national policy of sheltering-in-place. It swayed Bush. But four scientists who were infectious disease specialists also wrote a paper about the idea — a devastating critique. There was no science to support the notion that a national quarantine would halt the spread of infection, they wrote.  It could increase the risk of infection for people living in close quarters. Closing theaters, malls, restaurants, stores and bars — not to mention church services and athletic events — would have “serious disruptive consequences.” Closing schools was not only impractical “but carries the possibility of a seriously adverse outcome.” And so on.

The scientists concluded:

Experience has shown that communities faced with epidemics or other adverse events respond best and with the least anxiety when the normal social functioning of the community is least disrupted. Strong political and public health leadership to provide reassurance and to ensure that needed medical care services are provided are critical elements. If either is seen to be less than optimal, a manageable epidemic could move toward catastrophe.

The second issue is that there is surprisingly little evidence that lockdowns work. Last week, a statistician named William M. Briggs, who is solidly in the anti-lockdown camp, wrote a blog post comparing countries that locked down with countries that didn’t. As of May 12, the U.S. had 237 deaths per million people. Taiwan, a no-lockdown country, had 0.3 deaths per million. (The country has had a total of seven deaths.)

No-lockdown Sweden has had 347 deaths per million; lockdown Belgium, with a similar population, has had 763 deaths per million. Ethiopia, with a population of 109 million, had no lockdown — and a death rate of 0.04 per million.


“Death rates were more than highly variable; they were all over the place,” Briggs wrote of the data he had collected. “If lockdowns worked as advertised, we would not see such enormous variability in the death rates.”

“What should we conclude?” he added. “Strike that. What can we conclude? Only one thing: We cannot conclude that lockdowns worked.”

Let me point out one other fact about the pandemic of the late 1960s. Like many coronaviruses, the H3N2 virus came in waves. The last one began in the fall of 1969 and ended in early 1970. Assuming this coronavirus fades in the summer, there is a high likelihood that it will return with a vengeance in the fall and winter. If that happens, are you truly ready to lock down again?

jemyr,"Let's do math.  First remember 70% of Americans are overweight which ups the fatality numbers considerably. 

Now the most positive scenario, using Iceland's .5% death with a younger fitter group, and 60% needed for herd immunity:  750k+ dead in the US.   

It took NYC about 6 weeks to kill .2% of its population. So we could kill that 750k in a 4 month period to have a shorter impact of productivity loss on the economy due to the surge of funerals and death preparations and cancelled travel plans etc. etc. (We can shave a few weeks off since we are nearing 100k now).

However, if we go for the 4 month scenario we'll overwhelm our hospitals and that will add a lot of deaths.  Optimistically that adds another 750k minimum and you are back up to 1.5 million.  

But to lower that number you'd have to do Swedish style lockdown which is actually substantially damaging to the economy, which we don't want to do.  So we need people to go back to going to rock concerts, Comic Con, major medical conferences, lots of international travel, hanging out at bars, planning huge weddings, and working in large congregate settings.  And do so for 4 months while 1.5million people die.  Spending money on funerals might offset the economic dollars lost due to missing work to attend the funeral or do other things with your money.

But the problem is people won't do any of those things.  Because people voluntarily reduced their mobility by 60% when their state didn't lockdown because they were afraid.

But wait, there's more.

Sweden reduced its mobility when we project it had about half the infections per capita we currently have and it took a while to reach their hospital capacity, especially since a lot of deaths took place in care home and avoided straining their medical system.   But reducing mobility is part of their lockdown, which is economically damaging.

So let's say we open up to Sweden, but we have our fat problem and our way-we-treat-people-in-poverty problem, and our old-people-in-care-homes-want-to-go-to-the-hospital ""problem"",  that ups our fatality rate.  So even though we've already burned through about 100k dead, we still have much more fuel for this disease.  But we open up to no events over 50, open up schools, and continue a lock down on international tourism both going and coming.  This should cut the economic damage to the country by what?   Norway contracted GDP by 9% and Sweden by 6.5%.   If we emulated Sweden, and our per capita deaths matched them we'd be at 200,000 dead now.  Except the places where the GDP pickup would really count are New York, San Fran, LA, Houston, Seattle.   So Sweden style lockdown in New York would have done what?  

&gt;1% tax would make $50 billion. That’s about how much the Gates Foundation has spent, and they’ve saved about ten million lives.

They did not save 10 million lives in the United States.  If they saved 10 million lives in other countries, then the issue is the global population is 7.8 billion, with lack of access to hospitals, we're talking around 50 million dead globally on the optimistic side. That's if they open up their economies, which we need them to do so our economy doesn't take as big of a hit.

Frankly, this is all nonsense.  Pandemic plans are in place to not only save lives but to save economies which are part of our life.  Sweden is going to be locked off from the better responding countries.  New Zealand is opening up entirely, and Australia will too, and they will be able to trade freely with countries who quashed their infections.  China is able to open up its economy much farther because they suppressed their vectors so far.

We didn't follow our plan and our infection levels aren't under control.  The likeliest outcome of the abrupt shift of 60% lowered mobility to 15% lowered mobility in some places are startling hotspots, and civilian uncertainty, leading to behaviors that damage the economy out of fear.  Bots lying and political misinformation may spike the economy in the short term as people start believing the virus isn't capable of doing to them what it did to NYC so why not play beer pong in a bar, but the suspicion and fear it will create after reality comes into play will damage not just our economy but the global economy.

This is why Sith like behavior doesn't work.  It sacrifices the long term in favor of short term gains.  Individual greed replaces what is good for the collective, and in these scenarios killing huge quantities of people in the collective will really fuck up the individual's pocket book.  

Being honest with people, and working on clear communication with clear information was the correct plan.  If you tell people you have tested their area and the risk is at x level, then people feel more in control and will willingly rejoin the economy.  If they see everyone is playing games with information they'll simply opt out, which kills the economy.",1590251976,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gosh6e/carnegie_mellon_university_researchers_have/frk962s/,attend,2020-05-23

Also, just like with anything, the social aspect can be much stronger when you are physically present with your fellow community members. Just like how some people will do group marathons instead of just doing a 26 mile run on Strava or any other number of secular examples.

On the other hand: The people who already were careful, will not attend church, will not go to restaurants and will not go on vacation etc., which means opening up businesses will result in them having a lot of cost, but not at all enough customers anyway and the customers they get, are dangerous to the businesses and themselves and other customers and will get the numbers up.

HappyBavarian,"The Baptist congregation in Frankfurt's Rödelheim district must expect criminal investigations because of the apparently careless handling of the Corona hygiene rules. ""The health department is reconstructing the events very closely. ""As soon as we have all the findings, we will consider whether to take appropriate legal action,"" said a spokeswoman for the Frankfurt health department on Tuesday in response to an inquiry. She said that it was the responsibility of each individual congregation to ensure that the state ordinance for church services and religious gatherings was observed. ""They should have adhered to this in Rödelheim as well."" The city has no possibility to control all services and religious meetings in Frankfurt.

After a church service on May 10, 112 people in the prayer house in Rödelheim were infected with the coronavirus, according to new findings. According to René Gottschalk, head of the Frankfurt health department, 180 people attended the service two weeks ago. In the much larger Frankfurt Cathedral, only 70 people are currently allowed to attend a service. According to Gottschalk, another 150 people are currently being checked.

The community, which is organized as an association with many large families, stated that they had observed the rules of distance and hygiene. However, the church service visitors did not wear a mouth and nose protector and sang together in one room.

An infected person works in a daycare center

The country had issued a decree at the end of April. Since May, public services and religious gatherings are only allowed again according to its provisions. A minimum distance of 1.50 meters is prescribed. In addition, objects such as the collection basket may not be accepted and passed on. Suitable hygiene measures"" must also be ensured, for example disinfectant dispensers must be set up. All religious communities must ""display the rules clearly visible at the place of assembly"".

The regulations of the individual federal states are supplemented and concretised by the hygiene concepts of the major churches and religious communities. In them it is said, for example, that loud common singing is to be renounced, walking routes are to be marked, priests should disinfect their hands before preparing the gift. The concepts have been coordinated with the Länder and the Robert Koch Institute. The association from Rödelheim, however, does not belong to a larger church.

Meanwhile, it is considered certain that one of the two infected nursery school teachers who fell ill with Covid-19 in a Flörsheim day-care centre is a member of the Frankfurt Baptist congregation. The F.A.Z. learned this from a reliable source. The woman, who was assigned to the U3 emergency care, has apparently infected a colleague in the meantime. As the city of Flörsheim had reported last week without reference to the free Baptist congregation, the children are in domestic quarantine in the Main-Taunus-Kreis on the instructions of the health department; their parents can voluntarily have themselves tested for the virus. Three more day-care centre staff have been isolated at home and have had closer contact with the children.",1590498656,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gqwk4v/covidinfections_in_frankfurt_criminal/frv8cgb/,attend,2020-05-26

classicliberty,"I understand the argument against vouchers and charters. And as someone who has had to navigate these systems for my own children, they are not set up the way they should be. 

But assuming that 100% of children are given vouchers or attend charter schools, why would this be less desirable than having everyone attend a public school?

What is it about the organization of public schools specifically that makes them superior to other models? Personally I think having each local public school run independently with cirricuculm, hours, facilities and policies designed and tailored to meet the needs of the children in that specific area make the most sense. You might have schools in suburban or rural areas that only need to run half days, while urban lower income schools might need to run until 5pm. 

This is exactly what some charter schools are doing, but that traditional public schools (due to district wide or state policies) can't do.

You've already lost the argument. You yourself note that the system is already not set up well, but you want to somehow apply it to 100% of students? 

The same issues that public schools face with logistics get compounded by how private/charter schools add complications to the process. And as the point of privatization is profit, when the costs that are swallowed b the public school system have to be carried by the private institutions, how do you see that going down? 

There is no metric by which private schools will outperform public schools on an apples to apples basis, they only add middle men taking a cut of the money.",1590501628,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gqtpmp/the_pandemic_is_driving_americas_schools_toward_a/frvd9kf/,attend,2020-05-26

2. UK has travel bans
3. My firm has stopped all international travel. (this is a voluntary restriction based on fear/Risk mitigation... less so than legislation as it applies worldwide).

skepticaleconomist,"Well you shouldn’t use cloth masks because they’re worthless — 97% of particles make their way through most cotton masks. Researchers suggest you need as many as 6 layers of fabric to match the particle capture rate of surgical masks.

Wearing a mask is good. It signals to people you’re taking the pandemic seriously. Other than that, unless you’re in a closed space, using a properly fitted mask, AND social distancing, those masks aren’t going to help much. 

People ignore the fact that prior to Coronavirus, cloth masks were not considered adequate facial covering to prevent micro particle transmission. They carry a relative risk 13x higher than surgical masks and have been scientifically proven to be in effective at preventing flu-like illness among HEALTHCARE WORKERS. 

This mask issue has ridden a wave of dubious assumptions and overconfidence in the safety masks can provide. I would even argue that to be pro-mask at this point in the pandemic is to essentially be pro-business to the extent that business owners want to reopen early. If you’re able to boost the messaging that masks serve as an effective replacement and transmission deterrent, then you can open up the economy sooner. 

The best science to date in favor of cloth masks is an experiment with hamsters. RCT studies show that cloth masks are ineffective at preventing micro particle transmission and may pose an increased danger if not cleaned and worn properly. 

Social distancing works, masks are a marginal change that *may* reduce risks, but unlikely to if social distancing is abandoned.",1590192247,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gorhkq/majority_of_american_voters_support_mandatory/fri3x7w/,danger,2020-05-22

So it follows that you are upset that WHO is supporting this early reopening that Europe and US is doing. 

Sadly there is no way for an organization like WHO to be independent since they are dependent on external funding. There is a constant power struggle from those at the top, and other countries and organizations are forced to pick and choose allies. If you are upset that WHO seemed to be in China’s pocket when they didn’t originally recommend travel restrictions, that is fair. But airlines cancelled most flights to China anyway I believe in late January. At this point, many chose to not care. JFK didn’t do temperature checks.

But they can easily infer what's going on with the number of people needing hospitalization and number of deaths. They know that if those rates are steady or slightly decreasing, they are not in danger of being overwhelmed, which is what their strategy is all about.

The advantage should have been materialized before while the others were  in lockdown and sweden was trying to run business as usual as much as  possible. It just did not happen. 

Considering you know close to nothing about neither Swedeish nor other Scandinavian economies, how can you infer something of the kind?

ProdigalSon123456,"&gt; Now I'm Canadian, where we don't have these issues, so forgive my ignorance on all the craziness that goes on down there, but to the best of my knowledge doesn't the use of reasonable force stipulate that tasers are only to be used on armed assailants who are in danger of escaping?

In the majority of US law enforcement departments, it is justifiable as a means of obtaining compliance from individuals resisting arrest as long as the person looks like they're able to handle it.

Typical scenario:

Officer (approaching car): Ma'am, how much you've had to drink tonight?

Woman: Nothing.

Officer: Then why were you swerving all over the road?

Woman: Cuz, um... cuz I was -

Officer: Ma'am, please step out of the car.

Woman: No.

Officer: Ma'am, please step out of the car.

Woman (fumbles with putting the keys in the ignition): Look, I really need to go home...

Officer: MA'AM, take out the keys or else I'll add fleeing the scene of the crime to your charges.

Woman: What crime?

Officer: DUI.

Woman: I'm not drunk. I just want to go home!!!

Officer: Ma'am, out of the car NOW.

Woman: No!

Officer (opens door): Last warning, or I'll have to drag you out.

Woman: No!

Officer: Okay (opens door and grabs the woman)

Woman: NO! You can't do this! I have rights! (resists officer from removing her from her vehicle)

Officer: Ma'am, stop fighting with me or I'll have to use the taser.

Woman (crying): I'M NOT FIGHTING YOU! I JUST WANT TO GO HOME!

Officer: MA'AM STOP!

Woman's self-protective instincts take over and she gives a light kick to the officer in the chest as he tries to drag her out.

Officer: All right, I didn't want it to come to this.

Officer tases woman.

Observers outside the US (and maybe within as well) might see this as excessive force, but having family in LE tells me that this is textbook policy on use of tasers for a great swath of the nation.

I know this will be criticized to all hell and I'll get downvotes, but when the media alleges that police officers handled a situation with ""excessive force"" (especially ones with bodycams or video evidence), it's not on their own whim.

HGRDOG14,"Step 3: Synergy

Now comes the cost-cutting. This is supposed to be the hallmark of private equity, and, done right, it can work to the benefit of doctors and patients. But there are pitfalls unique to medicine, where aggressive cuts can lead to problems, some of them merely inconvenient and some potentially dangerous.

A doctor at Advanced Dermatology says that waiting for corporate approvals means his office is routinely left without enough gauze, antiseptic solution, and toilet paper. Even before the great toilet paper shortage of 2020, he would travel with a few rolls in the trunk of his car, to spare patients when an office inevitably ran out. The company declined to comment.

At the country’s second-biggest skin-care group, U.S. Dermatology Partners, a former doctor says a regional manager switched to a cheaper brand of needles and sutures without consulting the medical staff. The quality was so poor, she says, they would often break off in her patients’ bodies. Mortified, she’d have to dig them out and start over. She complained to managers but couldn’t get better supplies, she says. Paul Singh, U.S. Dermatology’s CEO, says the company uses a “reputable, global vendor for medical supplies.” “While our group may have standardized purchasing processes, individual providers have the autonomy to procure specific supplies that they need for a particular patient situation or patient population,” he says in a statement.

Doctors who join a private equity-backed group generally sign contracts that state they’ll never have to compromise their medical judgment, but some say that management began to intervene there, too. Dermatologists at most of the companies say they were pushed to see as many as twice the number of patients a day, which made them feel rushed and unable to provide the same quality of care. Others were forced to discuss their cases with managers or medical directors, who asked the doctors to explain why they weren’t sending more patients for surgery. Multiple practices also encouraged doctors to send home Mohs surgery patients with open wounds and have them come back the next day for stitches—or to have a different doctor do the closure the same day—because that would allow the practice to collect more from insurers.

That’s if doctors are performing the procedures at all. At Advanced Dermatology, several doctors say they were asked to claim that physician assistants, or PAs, were under their supervision when they weren’t seeing patients in the same building, or even the same town. Because PAs are paid less than dermatologists, this allowed the company to keep costs low while growing the business. In a statement, Eric Hunt, Advanced’s general counsel and chief compliance officer says that having PAs on staff enables the company to “provide access to quality dermatological care to more patients.”

Step 4. Rolling Up the Roll-Up

Advanced Dermatology was sold in 2016 by Audax to Harvest Partners LP, following a pattern that’s typical in the industry. At some point, after costs have been cut and profits maximized, most private equity-owned medical groups will be sold, often to another private equity firm, which will then try to somehow make the company even more profitable.

Having reduced most of the obvious costs, Advanced Dermatology began skimping on more important supplies, including Hylenex, according to doctors and other employees. The drug is an expensive reversal agent used when cosmetic fillers, which are supposed to make skin look plumper, go wrong. Not having enough is dangerous: Patients who get an injection that inadvertently blocks a blood vessel can be left with dead sections of skin or even go blind if they don’t get enough Hylenex in a matter of hours. The company says that it stocks Hylenex in every office that performs cosmetic procedures, and that it “has no records of any provider being denied an order for this medication.”

Advanced Dermatology also started giving even more authority to PAs, according to doctors and staff. Without enough oversight some were missing deadly skin cancers, they say. Others were doing too many biopsies and cutting out much larger areas of skin than necessary, leaving patients with big scars. Doctors who complained about the bad behavior say they saw PAs moved to other locations rather than fired or given more supervision. Hunt, the company's lawyer, says that all PAs get six months of training and are supervised by experienced doctors.

The staff coined a new medical diagnosis, “pre- pre- pre-cancer”

Advanced Dermatology also put more pressure on doctors to send biopsies to in-house labs. The move made sense financially, but some of the doctors didn’t trust the lab. One of its two pathologists in Delray Beach, Fla., Steven Glanz, had a history of misdiagnosing benign tumors, which led patients to undergo surgeries that were later found to be unnecessary, according to doctors who worked with him. Dermatologists who warned that Glanz was a danger to patients say that their complaints to Dr. Matt Leavitt, the group’s founder and CEO, were ignored. More procedures, doctors knew, brought in more money.

Glanz, who had been with the practice since its early days, was known to read slides under a microscope with a pistol on his desk. After he was arrested with a handgun, a folding knife, and a vial of methamphetamine crystals, he was fired and Florida’s state medical board fined him $10,000, requiring him to complete a five-hour course on ethics before he could resume practicing. But his former colleagues were unsettled; they knew Glanz’s signature was on years of reports that determined treatment for patients. Some slides were reevaluated, and pathologists noticed mistakes. Managers told some doctors and their staff that patients, even those who’d been misdiagnosed and had unnecessary procedures, were not to be told. Glanz pleaded guilty to stalking and a firearms violation and was sentenced to probation. When a reporter called his office and identified herself, the receptionist hung up. Further attempts to reach Glanz were unsuccessful. Advanced’s Hunt says that he was “formally released from employment three years ago,” but did not comment further.

Of course, some doctors pushed ethical boundaries long before private equity came into the picture. But critics of the industry, including doctors and investors, say management teams put in place by private equity firms tend to look the other way as long as a medical practice is profitable. Of the dermatologists with the highest biopsy rates in the country (between 4 and 11 per patient, per year), almost 25% were affiliated with private equity-backed groups, according to Dr. Joseph Francis, a Mohs surgeon and data researcher at the University of Florida.

Medical providers may have also been blurring ethical lines at U.S. Dermatology Partners, which was until recently on its second private equity owner, Abry Partners LLC. At four of the company’s offices in Texas, a doctor and his PAs were doing more biopsies than necessary, according to employees. These employees say the staff routinely called patients with benign lichenoid keratosis, small brownish blotches that usually go away on their own, and told them the growths should be removed. Under instruction from the doctor, the staff coined a new medical diagnosis, “pre- pre- pre-cancer,” and then talked patients into coming in for removal, employees say. Singh, the U.S. Dermatology CEO, says that the company trusts doctors to make the right decisions and that it monitors them through routine audits.",1590324171,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gpoxk0/how_private_equity_is_ruining_american_health/frnn2y1/,danger,2020-05-24

They continue to maintain social distancing policies and wear masks. This has sharply decreased the rate of spread. Look at other asian countries, Vietnam and Thailand in particular. Their governments took a strong position and implemented pretty strict social distancing and isolation procedures. This has again resulted in an effective method to combat COVID-19.

Now, compare this to America. A good portion of Americans don’t take COVID-19 seriously. We have a federal government that downplays the danger of COVID-19. People won’t even wear masks. 

In Asia, people are appalled at the American response. This is why many Asian counties, barring China and Malaysia, have done so well. Their government took the threat of COVID-19 and acted quickly and their citizens complied with the advise of doctors and scientists.

Breaking it down by your apparent logic you were taking it as a “preventative” then you got sick with something (ie. if you’re saying you think you got covid, the “preventative” didn’t work) so you doubled it. Whatever you had then went away (again crediting the HCQ for making it go away, implying it may have been covid, ignoring the fact that HCQ has been proven to not have any effect on covid). Then you resumed taking HCQ as a “preventative” for a disease you think you already had (and clearly did not prevent. Also, why would you need a preventative for something you think HCQ already cured?)


There is literally zero scientific evidence and no reason to believe HCQ works for coronavirus. It increases mortality for those who are ill with it.

She *very* slightly changed her tune at the end and thanked me for walking her through it all, but she was so glib that I dont think she internalized any of it.

Trimdon73,"We're certainly agreed on finding a balance, and it is true that there are all sorts of illnesses and diseases out there which we have to live with as a society. I think what made this different is that we just didn't know enough about it to make informed decisions, and there was a real prospect that healthcare systems would not be able to cope. As it turns out, although it has had a devastating effect among certain groups the toll hasn't matched the worst case scenario.

Hospital admissions has reduced significantly here in England and given the sizeable fall in the number of infections in the last 10 days, then reasonably we can expect hospital admissions to again drop significantly in the coming week. Given that we're beginning to get to a manageable level then I think the mindset should be that this is another disease/illness that we're going to have to live with. 

Again though, we can't be sure how it's going to go, and the danger is that when you look at the number hospital admissions around the end of March and the first couple of weeks in April, it is clear that the number of infections in the last couple of weeks in March, when the virus was left unchecked, was much, much higher than reported infections. And, when I say much higher I mean much higher than most of us thought the unconfirmed cases were, which tells us that it had gotten around to a point far in excess of what most of us realised.

That's why it has to be slowly and surely. Given that it was far more rampant than we realised, then there's the prospect that we may be caught out again, and the last thing we need is to be back to square one with lack of equipment, the prospect of not having enough beds, another lockdown and the associated impact on the economy and so on.

Melarsa,"Two different hospitals, same experience in both, both were ""baby friendly"" which means they need a certain percentage of moms to be considered ""successfully"" breastfeeding upon discharge to keep the designation, so they discourage formula and anything else that might ""not promote"" breastfeeding to a crazy degree. Turns out ""baby friendly"" isn't really mom friendly. Nor baby friendly. But hey, breastfeeding #1 at all costs! Woo!

I didn't know anything about it with my first and didn't have another hospital option with my second or else I would have gone non ""baby-friendly."" 

Breastfeeding is a great choice. By all means inform all new mothers about their options during pregnancy and after delivery. 

But witholding any type of safe nutrition from a baby is cruel, and withholding possible negative information about breastfeeding so women aren't able to make informed choices (maybe it's not so great if you have certain viruses that can pass to the baby via breastmilk!) is paternalistic and gross. If it turns out it's safe to breastfeed while sick with Covid-19, great. Let mothers know. If there's any question though, also let them know. It's not discouraging breastfeeding, it's being cautious during a pandemic. 

I'm not the only mom who's experienced some borderline dangerous behavior from baby friendly hospitals promoting breastfeeding at all costs. I don't have anything against breastfeeding (I exclusively pumped with my first for many months because that's how it worked best for us).

However, religious freaks, religious organizations, people refusing to even believe there's a virus out there and business owners not providing safe work conditions were issues we had to deal with throughout the crisis.

Problem is, the Balkans as a whole seems to try to re-open way too soon, Serbia is re-opening their borders soon and unless people show symptoms they're going to be free to come and go as they please. They're ignoring the fact that asymptomatic carries are actually the most dangerous when it comes to spreading the virus.

My country, Macedonia can't do jack to stop religious groups and people from gathering, being a corrupt shithole we have police overlooking blatant law breaking of family gatherings past curfew and such all the time. People don't even wear masks anymore outside, well some do, most do not.

ThomasEdmund84,"Something that has stood out about the global pandemic is that people seem to have very poor understanding of risk management both for themselves and populations.

Listening to the experts in Sweden their strategy is extremely sound IF their assumptions were correct, however some of their assumptions are very disturbing e.g.:

That Covid-19 fatality rate was very low among healthy people.

That due to infection rates the majority of fatalities would be inevitable, that 'the curve' could only be flattened but not ultimately reduced.

That having a consistent mitigation strategy over a long period would reduce the need for ever changing strategies and subsequent disruption.

To be fair to the country they did triple their hospital capacity, and put in several strategies like banning public gatherings so its not like they did nothing.

However

Most of the their assumptions have proven incorrect - Covid-19 is considerably dangerous in any population.

Other countries have shown that severe strategies can prevent deaths - NZ for example has 1/2 the overall pop of Sweden but Sweden has around 200 times the deaths of NZ *and is nowhere near finished with covid-19*.

Sweden use to have cyclical measles epidemics every 10 years or so before the vaccine because of this. 

In pre vaccine days a common way to mitigate a disease was to expose populations with little risk to it in order to protect the vulnerable and maintain a level of herd immunity instead of having it drop down with time.

They did a formal investigation into how the law could/should be interpreted once it became relevant in the pandemic perspective this spring. The conclusion was that it can only be allowed to restrict the movement of specific people or minor areas (such as a city block at max) if (and only if) there is a confirmed and exceptionally high risk of spreading a dangerous infectious disease by this specific person/these persons or in this specific general area. There can be no blanket restrictions affecting people in general, and that’s pretty much the end of the story as far as the law is written.

SizzleInGreen,"Not sure we have had the motivation previously.  I’m afraid of the (as far as what I’m aware) poor history of rushed vaccines.  My question was just face value though, odd it was downvoted, I think the answer is helpful and would help formulate my opinion on what is truly going to be a big decision.  Are successful vaccines (because there as certainly great ones with minimal side effects) typically slow to the public because the testing phase is unreasonable or because the development takes long?  Understanding that convoluted testing and time trials are probably for the best (again, dangerous past), how many of the successful vaccines we have were quickly developed in labs and simply held up for a long time in testing?  I’m hoping someone with knowledge can point out that x and y vaccines were developed in a month, they just were held up for 5 years and eventually rolled to the public with no ill effects... that would ease my concern.

What I do know is that the quickest vaccine to market was for mumps I believe, and took several years.  It was also successful and safe I believe.  

I am concerned about a vaccine rolled out before the year is up.  Vaccine side effects could be catastrophic if not properly tested... and just like I agree we should be on a stricter version of lock down to save lives during this pandemic, I think it behooves is to show patience (if possible) in developing a safe vaccine, again to save and not risk lives.

I think it will be hypocritical and curious to see many of the same people harping for stricter lock down adherence (in the name of every life we save matters), admonishing those who are reluctant to take a quickly available vaccine (which is in the same spirit).",1590238564,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gop5j8/the_coronavirus_vaccine_is_on_track_to_be_the/frjntgy/,dangerous,2020-05-23

It gets dicey after that.  Keep in mind I am not an expert in this subject; this is just info I've gathered.  N95 masks are designed for single use.  You can probably get away with a couple of days but the moisture you expel will contaminate the mask and could become dangerous in itself with moisture growth.  They are also uncomfortable and hot to wear.

The biggest problem is they are fairly rigid unlike a half face respirator.  In order to seal, it is generally accepted that both the wearer and another person to fit the mask need to be trained to do it properly.  Once on, you also can't touch it as, once you do, it is no longer fit properly and the seal is broken.

Finally, I believe the FDA has cleared KN95 for use by medical professionals in light of the lack of N95 availability.

namezam,"The problem with this, the problem with everyone that suggests this (aside from people’s math usually being wrong) is that these billionaires already donate obscene amounts of money. Bezos alone started a $2B fund for something, and think about Gates, he’s given away billions. When the government comes in and takes that money (has never happened in the US btw, new law is hard) a lot of billionaires will simply stop giving as much to charity. Do you think the government will handle that money more efficiently than Bill Gates using it for charity? It’s a dangerous, unprecedented slope. 

When people say things like “that guy has too much money! The government should take a few billion and give it to the people!!!” They fail to realize just how much some of these people already give away. I’m not arguing for or against someone having this much, or tax havens that create loop holes, but charitable giving in the US by billionaires is HUGE. 

As for the math part. 2019 Forbes 400 richest combined was $2.7T. And the stimulus was $2T. Imagine taxing those 400 at 100%. Just wipe them out, no wealth. And you barely get the first stimulus package, and we need another.

ButIDontReallyKnow,"Yes. It’s actually dangerous and counterintuitive to remain closed until a vaccine is released. 

Regardless, the lockdown isn’t primarily to stop the spread of the virus. It’s to stop hospitals from being packed. The virus will spread regardless of if there’s a lockdown or not. If you’re in lockdown, hospitals won’t be packed with patients. 

Recent studies on immunity have also revealed that monkeys infected with Sars Cov19 are capable of being immune at least temporarily, which will help expedite the process of creating a vaccine. 

Moreover, the country doesn’t just reopen every thing at once. It’s a process. First allowing small gatherings are gradually working its way up. 

Additionally, there is no evidence that a second wave will happen. Given the fact that some virus’ in the past have had them, it is certainly a possibility, but it is not possible to accurately predict it. 

Going off that, increases of cases being used as “evidence” for a second wave is reportedly an increase in testing.

stave000,"The immune response is split into two broad categories. The innate immune response (which reacts near immediately after infection) and the adaptive immune response (which takes about a week to develop). The innate immune response recognizes shared general features of bacteria, viruses, and fungi and begins general defense mechanisms depending on the type of pathogen. If these general defenses are not enough to eliminate the pathogen the adaptive immune response kicks in. Adaptive immunity is different because it is specific for the exact pathogen that you are infected with. The hallmarks of this response (which you have probably heard of in the news) are T cells and antibodies. Both recognize specific protein sequences unique to that pathogen and can then give a targeted and stronger response then the initial innate response. These cells are also what lead to long term ""memory"" of specific pathogens.


So what is a superantigen? So as I said, normally T cells recognize specific parts of proteins from a specific pathogen. These interactions are highly unique, so much that my T cells would most likely not work in your body and T cells to even other coronaviruses likely won't recognize SARS-COV2 (though there can be some overlap which had been reported but that is rare). Superantigens are rare proteins that are able to lead to activation of T cells without the specific protein they recognize being present. So normally we have trillions of T cells circulating in our body with only a tiny fraction (on the order of maybe hundreds out of trillions) able to recognize a specific protein sequences. The superantigen can lead to huge numbers of these ""nonspecific"" T cells getting inappropriately activated and causing them to start performing some of their functions such as killing cells or releasing cytokines which can have many effects on the body leading to what would be a sepsis like syndrome or uncontrolled inflammation in the blood causing fever spikes and serious drops in blood pressure.  Normally these responses are good because they are targeted to exactly where the pathogen is (so you are only killing cells infected by the pathogen and not others) but during a superantigen cytokine storm situation it could be very dangerous because the response can spread through the body and cause a lot of unnecessary damage.

A common superantigen disease is scarlet fever where you get widespread T cell activation from a single protein in the staphylococcus bacterium.",1590255234,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gp8byw/an_insertion_unique_to_sarscov2_exhibits/frkf41d/,dangerous,2020-05-23

The good news for you is that you have the right to hide.  No one is forcing you to do anything, and you aren’t preventing anyone from doing what they want to do.  We are moving on from the hysteria of a virus where more than 1/3 of those who get it don’t even know they have it.  Where less than 2% are even impacted in any meaningful way.  

When you get the flu, at least you know you have it.  But for some reason the lives lost from the flu don’t make the 24/7 news cycle.

PS - when you test more you get more confirmed cases.  Math is hard.  When you expose your immune system to a virus, you build up antibodies and you move on, just like we do every year with every single new strain of the flu.  And yes, some people get really sick and those with severe comorbidities may die.  This is a fact of life.  But again, please hide if you’re scared, and don’t ever drive a car because you could die in an accident, definitely don’t drink drinks with lots of sugar or use plastic straws.  

Be afraid.  Stay home and stay away from high fat foods and cholesterol- those things can absolutely kill you too.  Electricity is also quite dangerous as is fire.  Make sure you don’t get too much sun, and please, whatever you do, be safe and be super clean.  There are so many germs out there just waiting to get you.  It’s so scary.

Get tested.  Get a certificate indicating you are clean.  Insert a tracking chip just to be sure.  Sign up for as many tracking apps that you can.  Submit your DNA to the authorities.  Do your part and make sure to virtue signal as much as possible.  Shame anyone who isn’t as scared as you are.

 Your assumption is I stay home from the virus. Check.
 
 Your assumption is that there is no cure for any strain of coronavirus, yet MERS and SARS, other coronavirus, are treatable. 

  Coronavirus is a type of virus. The flu is ALSO a type of virus. The difference is that the flu can be self treated at home, and the flu also isn't a new virus we have never seen before. There are thousands of strains of coronavirus out in the animal population that we don't know about. 

 Flu kills 500k a year... So far this coronavirus has killed about 340,000 and we are in MAY. The year is NOT over. 
 The world has not survived Covid-19, yet. We don't even have a cure, yet. 

 Attempting to build up immunity to a virus that kills even healthy people is dangerous and stupid. A vaccine would help us. Attempting to just ""be immune"" is... Unrealistic? 

 That is the scary thing about Covid-19, the fact that some get extremely sick, some get mildly sick, and some have no symptoms at all. A virus that doesn't kill everyone is far more dangerous than a virus that is so deadly it kills everyone. It can stay under the human radar easier. People will say it's not so bad. But it is bad.

not_this_word,"Hi. I have immuno issues as well as multiple breathing issues. I'm also prone to bronchitis and pneumonia and in late stage pregnancy. I'm both a risk and at risk. Some people ARE bullshitting, but some of us legitimately cannot breathe in a mask. The CDC is aware of this, which is why they advise caution in those with breathing problems. By legal and medical standards, I'm not supposed to wear one. I accept any business' right to turn me away or (ideally) offer accomodations. Places that DO offer accomodations, I try to accomodate back to the best of my ability. 

For example, my doctor's accomodations are for me to be the very first or last patient and to get me checked in and hidden away in a room as quickly as possible for both the health of other patients and to avoid them complaining since they have to wear them.

I went home and decided to practice with a thin little cloth gaiter and discovered I can manage a whopping TWO minutes if I a) don't talk, b) don't engage in much activity and c) focus solely on steady, normal breathing (the latter is to avoid panic attacks, which just fuck up the entire thing). This is juuust long enough to check in at the doctor if I put it on outside the office and then be weighed and moved to a patient room. At which point, it comes off. At this point, I will be light-headed, but able to manage speech with some gasping. 

However, by four minutes, I am unsteady on my feet and have to remove it to breathe. I may or may not have a few spots in my vision or run into objects (gosh darned moving walls!). At this point, I will reflexively be gasping for air, no matter how focused I am on steady breathing. Saying anything until recovery is impossible; however, I will be more or less oriented x3 if you can manage to read my handwriting.

This is INCREDIBLY unsafe because if I misjudge my limits, I CAN pass out (there's a reason I stopped wearing Halloween masks when I was younger!) and fall, injuring myself, others or even my unborn child. At a place like the doctor/hospital, I am okay with this risk because the clinic is filled with trained medical personnel. This is NOT a good risk (for myself OR for others who may try to help me) outside of a clinical setting. And so, I don't wear the gaiter in places it isn't required. Instead, I try to avoid going anywhere in the first place. I am both a risk and at risk, but unfortunately have to get groceries (online shopping for WIC when?). I do my part to maintain social distancing (while the people IN masks walk right up to me). I keep my face turned down as much as possible and move away from areas where people congregate. Other than groceries really, I keep my dumb ass at home for both my safety and others.

The hypercapnia alarmists can go and play in traffic for all I care. Just remember that some of us are doing the best we can, please.

vanillabear26,"&gt; The needs of the many are to feed their families and earn a living and pay their rent and mortgages And need to get educated.

Yep, and how do they do that if they die from a disease that has no cure?

&gt; The few, are the less than 1% this is killing.

I am sorry that you feel so little empathy for the families of the 100k people who have died. Imagine that any one of them were your family members. You say 1%- pick one person you know that you are okay with dying from this. 

&gt; Sorry ...you have it backwards

That is usually true, except not in this case.

&gt; You aren’t just adults, you are scared children.

Friend, I am one person. I am not scared of anything except that there are people in the world who can care so little about people other than themselves. 

This virus may not be affecting you personally (and I hope to god it's not, for your sake), but that does not change the fact that, in a world without this virus, we would have 100,000 more Americans than we currently do. And I know, I know, *the flu kills 60,000 a year*. But we've had the flu to deal with for almost a century now, and that is a tragedy unto itself. 

My question for you is this: how many of your family members need to die before you stop insulting other people? Do you need to feel unsafe going to your job and feel the fear of carrying a disease home to your loved ones before you are okay with being on unemployment? Do you need to realize that there are so many other people in the world who have different perspectives than you do? 

Whatever does need to happen, I hope it does soon, because if you have a family that has to be around this kind of disregard for the very preventable sufferings of other people, then I feel sorry. 

Not for you, of course, you wretched apathetic narcissistic sociopath.

asdaaaaaaaa,"I simply said ""Insurance companies"", meaning all. It's common knowledge they'll write loopholes to get out of anything they can. Defend them all you like, doesn't change the fact that it's a common issue shared among almost all insurance types.

&gt;Business interruption insurance, part of a property insurance policy, typically is triggered when property is damaged or unusable as a result of a fire or natural disaster. Some policies also contain a civil authority clause that covers income loss if a government denies access to a business, such as if a fire at a neighboring property has made the area unsafe.

&gt;Many insurance carriers excluded coverage for viruses after another coronavirus — linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS — spread across the globe from 2002 to 2004. But some policies don’t have such exclusions, setting the stage for a legal fight over whether the new coronavirus and related closures constitute the kind of physical damage to property that triggers coverage for business income loss.

&gt;Legislators in several states — but not Illinois — have introduced bills to force insurers to cover COVID-19 related claims for small businesses, even when policies have exclusions. A federal draft bill has been circulating to create a government backstop to share the costs.

Oh look, another one for businesses

&gt;The Policy states that “period of restoration” “begins with the date of direct physical loss or physical damage caused by or resulting from a Covered Cause of Loss at the ‘scheduled premises’.”

&gt;The Policy explicitly provides for loss due to a virus through an endorsement: “We will pay for loss or damage by ‘fungi’, wet rot, dry rot, bacteria and virus.” […]

&gt;Twin City’s refusal of coverage breached its obligation and responsibility to provide coverage available through the Policy to Guajillo due to its covered loss of business income because its premises are unusable and uninhabitable and have lost all function, which constitutes a direct physical loss under the Policy.

Oh look, medical as well...

&gt;The class action complaint alleges that Defendants enter into STM contracts that purport to have only limited, well-defined exclusions of coverage, such as pre-existing condition exclusions for health issues occurring in periods ranging from six months to two years prior to the effective date of the policy. But, notwithstanding these commitments (and other prompt pay obligations), Defendants delay and deny valid claims by seeking burdensome (often completely irrelevant) health records stretching back as much as five years, and spanning across all of an insured’s healthcare providers, regardless of their relation to the claim or the ailment. As the complaint notes:

&gt;Defendants violate the law through employing an undisclosed and unlawful “five-year look-back,” through which they: (1) extend their pre-existing conditions exclusion well beyond the contracted-to period of six, twelve, or twenty-four months, in search of a condition to use as the basis to deny a valid claim; (2) engage in post-claims underwriting, in search of a condition that would have made the policyholder ineligible for Defendants’ insurance in the first place; and (3) delay policyholder claims to the point of constructive denial, by claiming they are constantly in need of difficult to obtain and legally irrelevant medical records and/or by pretending not to have medical records already in their possession.

Insurance companies are scummy, no doubt about it. Sure, maybe there's a few out there that follow rules, but most just search every nook and cranny, or post-claim underwrite to avoid paying up on something they said they covered. So why are you defending them?",1590554035,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/grakd3/new_wave_of_class_action_lawsuits_connected_to/fry45mt/,unsafe,2020-05-27

Hell, a few months ago, when people were just starting to discuss reopening, people would get hostile when we insisted that it wasn't enough to flatten the curve, you needed to reduce the degree to which it's endemic in the community. If it's still everywhere then reopening just accelerates the spread. 

It's like we've stopped a bunch of mini wild fires from converging into an uncontrollable inferno with the lock down. Instead of stamping out the mini wildfires, we're just going to remove the barriers that stopped them from converging. 

How many arguments did we have with folks who swore we had a plan for safe reopening? Who swore that people would wear masks, that no one would want to go to beaches or on cruises?

Puppywanton,"&gt; I agree that Amazon has bad workplace conditions, but I think this article is insinuating that he got the disease from Amazon warehouses which is not confirmed. 

The article is actually criticising Amazon’s unsafe workplace practices with a mass recruitment of 175,000 workers to ship out non-essential goods: 

&gt;  In mid-March, the company announced plans to hire 100,000 new workers to deal with a surge in online orders. In April, it began hiring 75,000 more to keep up with demand as it resumed shipping more nonessential items to customers.

It also talks about the lack of transparency in communicating Covid cases to their staff: 

&gt; The company’s official policy states that it informs all employees who have come in contact with an infected worker, but Amazon refuses to release official numbers of cases or deaths among its workforce.

It also mentions how they’ve handled whistleblowers:

&gt; Amazon also fired two tech workers who had publicly criticized safety and working conditions at the company’s warehouses

It also mentions how Amazon has decided to remove hazard pay for its workers:

&gt; Amazon is ending its $2 pay bump for workers if the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. shows few signs of slowing down.

Noisy_Toy,"Article text:

Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Michelle Steel condemned what she deemed to be a death threat against County Health Officer Dr. Nichole Quick this week.

Quick recently drew ire from some residents over her health order mandating that people wear cloth face coverings while in public. Several residents spoke angrily against the order during public comments at Tuesday’s Board of Supervisors meeting.

One woman, who identified herself as an attorney, disparaged Quick’s experience in the medical field and read her home address aloud, saying she planned to take a group to Quick’s home and “do calisthenics in masks on her front doorstep” in an attempt to prove that face coverings are unsafe.

The woman echoed what other critics have said about face coverings posing a danger to people’s oxygen levels. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has previously said that children younger than 2 and anyone with a breathing issue should not wear a face covering.

“When people start dropping like flies, and they will, I am going to ask every first responder in a 30-mile radius to roll lights and sirens to her front door and you had best pray they can revive whoever went down because if they can’t … I will be asking the O.C. D.A.’s office to charge it as murder,” she said.

Later in Tuesday’s meeting, Steel announced that Quick, who had joined the meeting via phone, had ended the call because one of the speakers had announced her home address.

“No one deserves to be threatened or intimidated the way she was,” Steel said during a media briefing Thursday. “I strongly condemn this behavior and it should never happen again.”

Orange County Sheriff’s Department officials said Quick has received several threats and has expressed concern for her safety.

“We have been in touch with her and are working to address those safety concerns,” said Carrie Braun, a spokeswoman for the Sheriff’s Department.

Orange County’s sheriff previously said that his department had no intention of enforcing residents’ face covering use.

“We are not the mask police — nor do I intend to be the mask police,” Sheriff Don Barnes told the county Board of Supervisors. “I think what we have seen repeatedly throughout the community is Orange County residents acting responsibly.”

On Friday, Orange County confirmed 145 additional COVID-19 cases and three more deaths, bringing the county’s death toll to 185 and the total number of infections to more than 5,900.

The number marks the county’s highest reported count since Saturday’s 175.

About 255 individuals are hospitalized in the county, including 98 in intensive care.

The cities most affected by the virus have been Santa Ana and Anaheim — the county’s most populous areas. Each has reported more than 1,000 cases, as other areas have ranged between 100 and 300, or far less.",1590893344,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gtr18e/oc_health_officer_receives_threats_over_face/fsdtxm0/,unsafe,2020-05-30

blublblubblub,"Main findings

1. Based on the cases we  studied, we are confident that regardless of the culture, healthcare  system, or geographic location in question, **a Google search peak  preceded the contagion downward changepoint in the recovering countries**.  These peaks even seemed to predict the containment of the contagion in  the countries, although the speed and strength of the influence of this  information on the population depends on many political and  communication variables and on the way the citizenry responds in each  country.
2. Although it would be necessary to identify new  cases to underscore this point, the Chilean case suggests that the big  increase in Google searches is linked to an increase in people’s  concern, in their management of information about the virus and in the  development of preventive behaviours (including changes in mobility  patterns). The joint manifestation of all these elements would explain  their association with a greater containment of this pandemic.
3. Our  findings might have public policy and crisis management applications.  The Google search peak could be used as a proxy for citizens’ concerns  and their response level, giving some guidance to both policy- and  decision-makers. Of course, it is not a very detailed indicator, but it  is fast, cheap and already available for use by any government.  Moreover, it can be used at a more detailed level, allowing the analysis  of patterns in regions within countries.
4. Today the world is  facing an unprecedented crisis that is also challenging traditional  methods of social research. Greater adoption of digital methods seems to  be an appropriate response to this crisis. These methods are safer (in  terms of preventing infection), faster, more accessible and much cheaper  than traditional ones. However, we must be extremely cautious about  protecting privacy rights. In the method proposed here, we do not see  unethical procedures that transgress relevant privacy boundaries.",1590183325,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/goscpi/using_google_trends_to_track_social_responses_to/frhny8v/,social,2020-05-22

&gt;Whitmer's announcement comes a day after she made several changes to further relax a sweeping stay-at-home order that has been in place since March, allowing social gatherings of 10 people or less immediately and telling retail businesses that sell goods they can reopen to customers for appointment-only shopping Tuesday.

&gt;That change also allows for non-emergency dental and doctor services to resume next Friday and Whitmer said Thursday that she would continue to relax the order as warranted by the data. She had previously allowed some retail businesses, such as garden stores and bicycle repair shops to reopen, and at 12:01 a.m. Friday, bars, restaurants and other businesses and offices on the Upper Peninsula and in northern Michigan around Traverse City, could open to customers, provided they limited their customers, made sure people stayed six feet apart and required masks.

&gt;Manufacturing and construction have resumed as well, under strict regulations. But many parts of Whitmer's rules — which have been challenged in court [and have been upheld so far btw, funny they don't mention that] and led to protests at the state Capitol — continue to disrupt the lives of Michiganders.

&gt;Large gatherings, for instance, are not allowed, and people must wear masks or other face coverings when in closed spaces. Barber shops and hair salons remain closed, as door sporting and entertainment venues, gyms, casinos and more. Short-term vacation rentals are not allowed. Schools and camps remain closed.

&gt;The extension of the order means all of those rules will remain in place at least until June 12, unless Whitmer decides to relax them before that.

What this means, if you cut through DFP's bullshit, is that far more people are able to go out, to go to work, etc., but the core stay at home order remains. Her shift to ""safer at home"" reflects a shift in policy. Previously ""stay home stay safe"" implied that we should stay home as much as possible. ""Safer at home"" reflects what it says. It's safer to stay home, but we have to go out and about.

srelma,"&gt;Were reporting something like 140k deaths in the US, 

Who is reporting this number? [This](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) says 97k. [This](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) says 96k. Pretty much the same (the small difference must be coming from differences when data is updated). 

&gt;CDC is working to display actual covid deaths, these numbers are updated weekly and daily. Turns out were only at about 74k. Half of whats reported. [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm)

74k number is for ""COVID-19 deaths"". In addition there is a column labelled ""Deaths with pneumonia and COVID-19"". That's 32k. If you add these two together, you get pretty close to the numbers above. 

But sure, there is a grey area, what exactly is a ""COVID-19"" death. If COVID-19 destroys your lungs and then you get pneumonia that kills you, is that a ""COVID-19 death""? If you're weakened by cancer and then COVID-19 pushes you over the edge and you die. Is that a COVID-19 death? 

Furthermore, that CDC data shouldn't be compared with the online data for the latest situation because it is clearly delayed. That data records deaths according to the actual date of death, while the online data is just the latest deaths without any attempt to classify when these people died. So, you can very well have statistics that have deaths that we know occurred, but not more than that, for instance when exactly the death happened. If that data is not available, it is unlikely to be added to that table. As you can see for the COVID-19 deaths, they are much higher in April than May, with the latest data (deaths in the week ending 5/16) with only 1500 cases, which is about 1/10th of the peak value. If you compare this to the other sources that I listed, they show only a relatively modest fall (\~20-30%) in deaths since the peak. The most likely explanation is that the CDC data for the latest couple of weeks does not include all the cases yet. Once they are added, the number will match with the other sources. 

&gt;You cant keep a lockdown going until the Virus is gone. The Vaccine is 18 months away at best.

Correct. Fortunately, going back to the situation in February (=reopen everything as they were then) and staying in lockdown until the vaccine is ready are not the only two options. 

&gt; Time to fucking move on, people are going to die regardless, the CDC now reports that covid doesnt spread easily by contact, whicheans if you wear a mask and wash your hands like a normal human being, youre as good as you can be.

Do you have good suggestions for how to make for instance people in Michigan to wear masks? 

But yes, I support phased removal of social distancing measures.  

&gt;The lockdowns didnt stop people from going out and doing shit, so lets say we double the number dead reported by the CDC, that brings us to 148k or so. The us has a population of 340 million. Sorry, its not significant.

Ok, what is significant? 9/11 killed 3000 people. Was that significant?",1590183767,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/goicek/the_death_toll_in_sweden_is_catastrophically_high/frhosai/,social,2020-05-22

The state has seen sustained reductions in hospitalizations. From May 8 when the first counties moved to yellow to yesterday, the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized dropped by nearly one thousand – from 2,618 to 1,667.

Probably should have elaborated. (Saw the 140k someone posted to me, figured that was the new number my bad) yea, we should focus specifically on Covid and not influenza or Pnumonia, there is a grey area but we cant consistently rely on that.

The guy I replied too brought it up.

I believe its currently illegal in Michigan due to a new executive order to go out without a mask in Mi, could be wrong. 

Maintain mask awareness and let business enforce it, if that doesnt work, get police involved. Right now business can be fined for not adhereing to specific guidlines. 

Also maintain social distancing where able. 

Do those two things and open, i dont see it as a black and white thing, open everything or keep everything closed. But the Gov. Just allowed Travis City to allow gathering and lifted the stay at home order so she could have a grad party for her daughter. 

She is making insane grabs for power with her resteictions.

We have 7000 people die per day in the us for every kind of reason. 

So in 4+months covid has killed about as many people as 12 days does.

lobax,"Sweden had two goals: 

1) Flatten the curve, keep the healthcare system from being overrun
2) Protect the elderly, prevent it from reaching them

One succeeded, one failed. Pretending 2 wasn’t a goal is not being honest and the expert authority openly admits that they failed there. 

WHY they failed is much more complicated then lockdown or no lockdown. Sweden was one of the first Scandinavian countries to recommend the elderly to isolate and to ban visits from elderly homes, a week to a month ahead of the others. The voluntary social distancing methods have, according to the data, worked just as well as the mandatory rules in Denmark - same reduction in travel, reduced consumption etc. 

And, importantly, the epidemic didn’t develope the same way everywhere - it exploded Stockholm. Malmö and Scania are doing just as well of not better then Denmark per capita, despite drastically different rules (at first at least - Denmark now has the same rules). 

And here is where a crucial bit of context comes in - I think the mistakes came early on and had nothing to do with having a lockdown or not. Thousands of families with kids went on vacation  during spring break in week 9 from Stockholm to the alps and Italy - Malmö had theirs week 8. A massive concert was held in Friends Arena in early March for the Swedish Eurovision event. Stockholm’s elder care is fully privatized with the highest levels of hourly paid employees that cannot afford to be home sick and have limited training, while Malmö has publicly run elder care facilities with one of the lowest rates of hourly labour and highest rates of educated personnel in the country. 

All these factors made the epidemic a bomb in Stockholm, but not in Malmö - despite the exact same rules.

They're ignoring the fact that asymptomatic carries are actually the most dangerous when it comes to spreading the virus.

My country, Macedonia can't do jack to stop religious groups and people from gathering, being a corrupt shithole we have police overlooking blatant law breaking of family gatherings past curfew and such all the time. People don't even wear masks anymore outside, well some do, most do not.

srelma,"I can easily see some people in the government benefiting from being able to pour money to their crony friends through illegal wars or spying the people en masse through terrorist laws, but I can't see what would be the benefit from anyone in government for being able to stop people from going to have a haircut or work in an office or forcing people to wear a masks.

The closest I can think of any of the terrorist laws would be some sort of contact tracing app whose data is then collected into a central server. But in order to make people to actually install that app on their phone, the government would have to convince them that it is not going to do that. When it's snooping people's internet use through NSA, it doesn't have to ask anyone to install anything on their computers. 

And in any case, unlike terrorism, this would come to an end pretty soon. The terrorism laws have been in place soon for 20 years and there is no sign of them being taken down. You can credibly make the case that terrorists are going attack immediately if they are taken down. However, once there is a vaccine for covid-19, you can't make a case for any social distancing orders or anything limiting people's liberties based on a threat of a pandemic.

Immuno-Guy-PhD,"The models weren't wrong mathematically, they were just extremely bad at predicting human behavior. When you tell billions of people over and over again that their parents and grandparents are gonna die or they could wind up in the ICU, they perk up and listen. Voluntary mitigation efforts were over and above what any of these models predicted at all.

If you look at the methods used by the ICL group who famously predicted that 2.2 million Americans would die without non-pharmaceutical interventions, they basically predicted 50-75% compliance with all these measures. As in, they figured in the government mandated social distancing, then we'd still have 25% the number of birthday parties, house parties, movie nights, group trips, etc... He assumed that 30% of people who were diagnosed would basically say, ""fuck it, I'm going out anyway.""

Then some researchers from Sweden in early April took that same model and cried out to their government, ""look, there will be 96,000 deaths by the end of June if we continue down this path."" The government ignored that report and continued. Today they are around under 4,000 deaths. Why? Because people take precautions. Because even when you *don't* mandate social distancing, house parties and birthday parties and movie nights plummet to well below 30% of normal values in the middle of a once-in-a-century deadly pandemic.

We may find the true challenge is not in containing this to well below Ferguson's best case scenario 1.1 million deaths, but in managing to get people to safely spend money to keep the economy going.

caceomorphism,"&gt; Science relies on the scientific method and the hypothesis is not being proven consistently. 

In order to science, some numeracy and reasoning is required. Picking out random factoids and quotes to cast doubts are not.

The reason that Sweden's social distancing hasn't worked as well is right there in the article.  It points to, ""society's high level of trust in authority as the reason why people can follow guidelines to stay socially distanced without many of the same rules as the rest of the world.""

Sweden relying on that generally true statement is the problem as the effective contact rate of *all* citizens following social distancing rules is very different from the effective contact rate of of the *majority* of citizens following the rules. This is because of the long asymptomatic infectious period and the high transmission rate. The negative effect of a few bad actors in the population, not following social distancing guidelines, is disproportionately responsible for Sweden's predicament.

If society as a whole followed the rules, social distancing would reduce the reproduction number for clusters of population to more than 1 and less than 2 but more importantly leave population clusters identifiable to further isolate. Cumulatively the reproduction number would be less than 1, leading to the eventual disappearence of covid.

Sweden is trusting it's citizens to do the right thing. Philosophically that's great and makes me love Sweden. Unfortunately mathematically that isn't going to work. That doesn't mean a full lockdown is necessary; it only means that the *possible* Typhoid Marys who refuse to follow the guidelines must be put into lockdown. The social stigma of being identified as an asshole putting others at risk isn't enough.

Also, you're arguing the wrong thing: ""There is no correlation between **fatalities** and lockdown stringency."" That's a claim that is harder to prove one way or another because you're throwing in too many variables from how social interactions happen different culturally, to small differences in hygiene behaviours from country to country, the age distribution of the country, and so on. The above quote is a rhetorical trick misusing statistics and not any indicator of fact.

What you should be looking for is whether there is a correlation between **total infections** and lockdown stringency.

Sweden can't rely solely on the effect of suggested social distancing rules while maintaining a normal pace. A few bad apples will eventually negate any value of that approach.

&gt;&gt; Many of the pro-herd contingent are pro-life. That means some of the pro-herd contingent could be pro-choice  

&gt; Based on what? Your opinion or anecdotal evidence? Post actual data and facts to support your assumption.

greypowerOz,"&gt; There's a LOT of confouding evidence 

only from the point of view that ""if a thing works for XX country it MUST work exactly the same for YY country"".

IE in dense population centers where you are NOT locked down, and the virus is actively spreading, and people ARE out and in contact, then masks and lots of hand washing are the way to go.

In areas like Oz where INITIAL impact of the virus was met with strict lockdown, (almost everyone stayed at home from VERY early)  the spread of the virus was contained - the chain of transmission was broken.

So the virus has (WE HOPE !!!!) burned through the first wave of infections. So we never were in a situation where MOST people saw any risk-reduction from wearing masks.

&gt; government mandated lockdowns were fiercest.

out govt ""asked us"" to social distance, and too few people did (see, we have just as many dickheads as the USA per capita..)  so they almost immediatly made it a LAW to stay isolated, fined a few people $5,000 and made sure that was on the news.

“I was bored and there’s nothing else to do,” he said about the parties.

On Friday, 300 to 400 people filled the warehouse. On Saturday, hundreds more showed up. Mobley broke open a coronavirus-themed pinata filled with mini bottles of Rumple Minze, and photos show the crowd of people packed together to take a picture.

When asked if he felt that hosting the party was irresponsible, Mobley said he had no comment. “I feel like your body is going to be stronger if you’re out around people and — I don’t know,” Mobley said. “I don’t want to get into this politics stuff. I didn’t really think about it.”

He said he believes everyone is going to catch COVID-19 at some point and “being cooped up in the house is not going to keep people from getting it.” He has known several people with coronavirus.

When asked if he would have another party, Mobley said if the bars were not opening back up Friday, then he probably would.

Hundreds lambasted Mobley on social media over the parties, which he posted about on his public Facebook. Various Fort Worth-based Facebook groups shared the photos and criticized Mobley and those at the party.

In turn, Mobley posted screenshots of those posts and said his “new job is pissing off Karens.” He specifically targeted a private Facebook group for Fort Worth women.

“I kind of wanted to troll them,” Mobley said about the women’s group. “To be honest, it didn’t upset me at all, it kind of made me laugh more than anything.”

Fort Worth police showed up at the party on Friday in response to several noise complaints, Mobley said. Officers “were cool” and “were just mad about the noise,” he said, but added he did not talk to officers directly. He said they eventually “kind of just went away and never came back.” The party lasted until about 3:30 a.m. on Friday.",1590192213,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gouuvq/texas_man_threw_400person_coronavirusthemed/fri3v43/,social,2020-05-22
skepticaleconomist,"Well you shouldn’t use cloth masks because they’re worthless — 97% of particles make their way through most cotton masks. Researchers suggest you need as many as 6 layers of fabric to match the particle capture rate of surgical masks.

Wearing a mask is good. It signals to people you’re taking the pandemic seriously. Other than that, unless you’re in a closed space, using a properly fitted mask, AND social distancing, those masks aren’t going to help much. 

People ignore the fact that prior to Coronavirus, cloth masks were not considered adequate facial covering to prevent micro particle transmission. They carry a relative risk 13x higher than surgical masks and have been scientifically proven to be in effective at preventing flu-like illness among HEALTHCARE WORKERS. 

This mask issue has ridden a wave of dubious assumptions and overconfidence in the safety masks can provide. I would even argue that to be pro-mask at this point in the pandemic is to essentially be pro-business to the extent that business owners want to reopen early. If you’re able to boost the messaging that masks serve as an effective replacement and transmission deterrent, then you can open up the economy sooner. 

The best science to date in favor of cloth masks is an experiment with hamsters. RCT studies show that cloth masks are ineffective at preventing micro particle transmission and may pose an increased danger if not cleaned and worn properly.

writeronthemoon,"Ok so...everyone is going to downvote me to hell...

I went to the gym. Yesterday. For the first time since March 17th. My mental health has been slowly declining since lockdown began, and I’ve been feeling quite depressed. I’m unemployed and I already had suffered from depression before.

It’s been hard for me to keep up with home workouts, because finding some really light is not easy. I know, there are so many out there and I should have tried harder and I’m stupid. I get it. Just let me share my experience.

So with some fear in me I very tentatively went to the gym. I wore a mask. I used my keychain attachment thing to press buttons and open doors. 

It was not enjoyable. I felt nervous the whole time I was there. Having to use a locker and even wiping it down etc., thinking of how many other people, who could unknowingly be infected and have used it, made me nervous.

Everyone followed social distancing, including me. But not many besides employees and myself were wearing masks. There were very few people there.

In the end, my body felt good but my mind felt disturbed. My anxiety was high. It was not worth it.",1590193032,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gokm4t/a_majority_of_americans_say_they_wont_go_to_the/fri58w0/,social,2020-05-22

lobax,"Sweden had two goals: 

1) Flatten the curve, keep the healthcare system from being overrun
2) Protect the elderly, prevent it from reaching them

One succeeded, one failed. Pretending 2 wasn’t a goal is not being honest and the expert authority openly admits that they failed there. 

WHY they failed is much more complicated then lockdown or no lockdown. Sweden was one of the first Scandinavian countries to recommend the elderly to isolate and to ban visits from elderly homes, a week to a month ahead of the others. The voluntary social distancing methods have, according to the data, worked just as well as the mandatory rules in Denmark - same reduction in travel, reduced consumption etc. 

And, importantly, the epidemic didn’t develope the same way everywhere - it exploded Stockholm. Malmö and Scania are doing just as well of not better then Denmark per capita, despite drastically different rules (at first at least - Denmark now has the same rules). 

And here is where a crucial bit of context comes in - I think the mistakes came early on and had nothing to do with having a lockdown or not. Thousands of families with kids went on vacation  during spring break in week 9 from Stockholm to the alps and Italy - Malmö had theirs week 8. A massive concert was held in Friends Arena in early March for the Swedish Eurovision event. Stockholm’s elder care is fully privatized with the highest levels of hourly paid employees that cannot afford to be home sick and have limited training, while Malmö has publicly run elder care facilities with one of the lowest rates of hourly labour and highest rates of educated personnel in the country. 

All these factors made the epidemic a bomb in Stockholm, but not in Malmö - despite the exact same rules. And we saw the same similar factor make the epidemic explode in Belgium for instance, despite a lockdown.",1590185024,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/goicek/the_death_toll_in_sweden_is_catastrophically_high/frhr4xl/,concert,2020-05-22

NickDanger3di,"Well, that's what nursing homes are often commonly used for. But for a highly contagious virus, a little common sense should have told the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that using facilities dedicated to covid patients should have been done. 

That's what happens when there is no central authority with the clout to manage a crisis. The whole point of having a team of experts, creating a coherent response to managing a crisis (like a pandemic), is that ""the way we always do it"" isn't going to be effective. If it is, then it isn't a crisis to begin with.

From where I sit, our country simply isn't capable of handling any kind of crisis that isn't the standard FEMA handbook. That's been obvious from the beginning, and continues to be obvious every day, with leaders at all levels of our governments - State and Federal, conservative and liberal - pointing fingers and squabbling instead of acting effectively and in concert.

iieer,"The per capita death rate in Scania of Sweden is almost exactly the same as the national for Denmark. However, if people have to cherry-pick a region —one with one of the lowest deaths rates in the country— to be able to make a reasonable comparison with another country, the statistics are flawed.

I could also cherry-pick Region North Jutland, Region Central Jutland or Region Southern Denmark (3 of 5 regions in the country), and Scania's numbers would look bad. Rather, what can be seen in all Nordic countries is that there is a strong correlation to density, with the hardest hit region in each country being the most densely populated, i.e. the capital region: Copenhagen of Denmark, Helsinki of Finland, Oslo of Norway and Stockholm of Sweden. Copenhagen and Stockholm have almost exactly the same density. Copenhagen's death rate (220 per million) is very high compared to Denmark's national rate (97 per million), but it is very low compared to Stockholm's (780 per million). Indeed, this hardest hit and most densely populated region of Denmark has a per capita death rate that is lower than the rate for entire Sweden (389 per million), a country that has a very low density of only 23 people/km2 (Denmark = 135 people/km2). So, if we compare countries overall, or regions in each country that reasonably can be compared, Sweden is far above the others in deaths per capita.

Interestingly, Scania, one of the least affected regions of Sweden, is right next to Copenhagen, the hardest hit region of Denmark. The medical officer in Scania has been very happy about Denmark's policy, saying that it [probably shielded Scania too](https://www.sydsvenskan.se/2020-04-29/danska-beslut-begransar-smittspridningen-i-skane).

The other factors mentioned, holidays, a concert and deaths in care homes facilities for elderly, don't explain the difference either. Denmark and Norway also had large number of people returning from holiday in the Alps. There are indications that a large horse show (twice as many people as the Friends Arena show in Sweden) in March played an important role in Denmark's outbreak. Sweden's percentage of deaths in care homes is [pretty average for Europe](https://ltccovid.org/2020/04/12/mortality-associated-with-covid-19-outbreaks-in-care-homes-early-international-evidence/) (table on page 18 of pdf). At 49%, it is higher than Denmark (34%), but lower than Norway (58%). Even if Denmark's total deaths were upped to get a care home percentage that is similar to Sweden's, it would still only change the total from 561 to 808, equalling a change in rate per million from 97 to 140 (Sweden's rate is 389 per million).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

However, I do think Sweden has done remarkably well for the policy. Hospitals have been under pressure locally, but they managed. Overall hospitalizations have never been above the country's capacity. Except perhaps for its Nordic neighbours that in many ways are similar, there are probably very few countries in the world that could replicate the results of Sweden if following the same policy. Most countries would rapidly overburden their hospital system.

It is worth noting that reviews of excess mortality, e.g. [this one](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/21/world/coronavirus-missing-deaths.html) by NY Times, strongly suggest that the Scandinavian countries have little or no underreporting of corona-deaths. Their data is likely to be quite accurate, whereas several other countries appear to have overlooked a significant number of corona-deaths.",1590192390,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/goicek/the_death_toll_in_sweden_is_catastrophically_high/fri45v4/,concert,2020-05-22

Boo_R4dley,"Which means the mayor is incompetent. 

The mayor *should* be looking out for the health and well being of the residents of their town. If money is an issue for the residents they should be pushing the state to fix their unemployment system. They should be pushing for landlords to forgive rent and for mortgage holders to at the very least shift 3 or 4 months payments and add them to the end of the mortgage 20 years from now (especially since they’re all getting paid anyway because of mortgage insurance). They should be finding ways to support small local businesses that shouldn’t be open right now and finding every way possible to facilitate people staying at home. 

It’s a very simple and easy issue to see. Any politician pushing to “reopen the economy” or for getting people back to work is not putting the people first. They are putting corporate money at the top of their priority list. The politicians who are trying to get more stimulus checks out to pay bills, or who are advocating for bill forgiveness so people can stay home are trying to save lives. M

Reopening the economy has nothing to do with your local bar or the hair salon that Sandy runs in her walkout basement. It has everything to do with massive corporations worried about losing millions in revenue and the stock market implications of that. The states and federal governments could put together plans to make sure everyone is taken care of. They could make sure we all have food and water and that our housing is safe. But they won’t because the corporate millionaires and billionaires still want to get paid. 

Because those millionaires and billionaires want to keep making money they have invested tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars into creating campaigns and “grassroots” efforts online that convince people that masks and stay at home orders are a violation of free speech. 

If you’ve been lead to believe that a mask to protect others is a violation of your rights. If you’ve been convinced that you should be returning to work. If you’ve been told that you should be allowed to visit a barber or salon with dozens of other people in a day. If you’ve been convicted that bars should be open because people need an “outket”, then you are the unfortunate victim of an expensive corporate propaganda campaign. 

They corporations don’t care about your food, or bills, or mortgage. If they did they’d be paying you more and you’d be comfortable like the Cleavers or the Nelsons, but you’re not. You’re a cog in the machine that they pay the absolute minimum they can to get the job done. You don’t matter to them and going to a concert or a protest to “reopen the country” just proves what a completely idiotic and complacent sheep you are. 

That mayor is one of two things. An idiotic sheep or a wolf in sheep’s clothing. They’re not acting in the best interest of their residents and the members of the board and the village staff that shut that concert down deserve to be commended.",1590214084,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/goli5k/utah_lockdown_protest_concert_forced_to_change/frizmyu/,concert,2020-05-23
RogueDevlin,"Yes, testing could be done. 

The government does not want to, for a lot of reasons.  

First, the man in charge (Lopez Gatell) holds a grudge when he was fired during the H1N1 break, because the president at the time did not accept his Sentinel method to count the cases, and discovered a lot of inconsistencies with his data.  

The current president loaths that previous president, so he put the fired guy in charge with his Sentinel method.  

Testing everyone will prove that the measures taken by the government were irresponsible and late. 

It was mid March when government offices were sending  out visual communication staying there was nothing to worry about. They allowed a large concert in Mexico City (Vive Latino). The president himself posted a video on his Twitter telling the people to go out and enjoy restaurants. He was touring the country, rallying people and greeting and kissing everyone. In March!  

It is not completely true that we pay everything out of the pocket. There is social security for a lot of people. But in another idiotic move, the president disappeared the Seguro Popular for people that could not apply to any health benefits and changed it to his own model. The system was in chaos when the pandemic hit. Contracts for medicines has been halted with laboratories.  

The government also decided to sell a lot of facemasks to China in February, which now they say, it may have been a mistake. But at the same time Lopez Gatell was continuously regarded the use of facemasks as not necessary and to significant for every day use.  

And last, the government has made it clear their only concern is the Oil, the Mayan Train, the populist handouts and baseball. Fundings are going towards that. There has been almost zero stimulus to companies or to people who have lost their jobs.  

Going specific intro testing, the government initially centralized all nationwide testing in one institute in Mexico City. Slow and ineffective process. The government forbade private labs and hospitals  to do tests. And the criteria was very specific. It took more than a month for other labs and hospitals to start testingd the requirements were still very strict.  

At this point, the data presented in the daily conferences, does not include the results of people being tested in private labs.

So it is mostly political reasons why testing is not done.",1590214180,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/goyd13/mexico_city_paramedics_overwhelmed_with/frizqvb/,concert,2020-05-23

JohnIsAFKB,"Well here's my two cents. One approach could be to get a common baseline to go from. For example you can ask: do you believe in natural pandemics even if this isn't one? Like literally: do you believe it is possible that a virus could infect a major part of the global population (some people can't fathom big events happening, this condition has a name but I forgot which one)? If they don't then maybe you can point to historical examples. If they do you can go from there. Like: ok, so what makes this one different to a natural one? Maybe take the 1968 or 1918 flu as an example to go from. 

Second, I don't think arguments and sources are going to help you. I think other (more social/emotional?) stuff could help. For example, do you know they look up to someone (a celebrity, a friend, ...) who doesn't agree with them? You could casually name drop them.

The media and the powers that be (economic and political) have a huge incentive to make us think that the country has been a 24/7 rock concert and that we’re missing out, to make us get out there and back to consuming. But the mobility data doesn't lie and shows that people were still quite apprehensive about going out as of 5/16. If the data updates for this weekend shows that people finally just gave up and there’s no noticeable uptick 2-3 weeks later in states that are actually reporting data accurately then yes, it’ll likely mean that we can either be relatively safe out in the world or that people have adjusted their behaviors enough that we can be relatively safe with those adjustments.

tractiontiresadvised,"Although this article is missing some important facts that actually make the story more interesting, like the name of the orchestra (Orquesta Experimental de Instrumentos Nativos) and the sorts of instruments they play (mostly panpipes, flutes, and percussion). The BBC [article](https://www.bbc.com/news/the-reporters-52760380) referenced by the Variety article notes:

&gt; The musicians, most of whom have never left Bolivia before, were expecting to spend just over a fortnight this spring touring east Germany's concert halls.

[...]

&gt; Only on Monday did they get the chance to step inside the castle for the first time as tours for the public reopened.

[....]

&gt; Some members of the orchestra speak to their families in Bolivia. For others, communication is near impossible as internet and telephone signals are patchy outside Bolivia's main cities.

&gt; Many of the musicians play a major role in providing for their families financially, and being unable to do this at the moment is exacerbating their anxiety.

[....]

&gt; Some go further than a raised eyebrow, perhaps confused by the fact that the musicians appear to be flouting Germany's social distancing rules, as it may not be immediately obvious that they have been allowed to classify themselves as a family unit.

&gt; He says on one of the occasions the Bolivians played a game of football on the meadow directly in front of the castle. They soon found themselves surrounded by six police officers ""in full riot gear, just short of a helmet"", says Timo Kreuser, one of three German musicians who helped facilitate the tour and are staying with them.

&gt; ""They came from from left and right and started to encircle us and things got a little tense,"" recalls Miguel.

ComplexFUBAR,"‘Sorry, no mask allowed’: Some businesses pledge to keep out customers who cover their faces

Kevin Smith, owner of the Liberty Tree Tavern in Elgin, Tex., put up a sign banning customers from wearing face masks inside his bar. (Liberty Tree Tavern)

By 

Teo Armus 

May 28, 2020 at 6:11 a.m. CDT

For 64 days, Kevin Smith had shut down the Liberty Tree Tavern to comply with government orders. Now he was cleaning and disinfecting and removing stools to cut seating by three-quarters as he prepared to reopen the bar.

Plexiglass screens had gone up at the supermarket checkout. His neighbors in Elgin, Tex., were still wearing masks outside, even after it was no longer mandated by the county. He did not think such a response was necessary, he said, and he wanted to push back.

“Sorry, no mask allowed,” read the poster taped to the front door of his bar Friday. “Please bare with us thru the ridiculous fearful times.”

As statewide coronavirus orders are easing, many stores and restaurants nationwide have taken the opposite route: They have made face coverings a requirement, kicking out those who fail to comply and even going to court to enforce their directives.

Yet in the emergent culture war over masks, a handful of businesses — the Liberty Tree Tavern among them — are fashioning themselves as fortresses for the resistance.

“If we’re only allowed to be at 25 percent capacity, I want them to be the 25 percent of people that aren’t p-----, that aren’t sheep,” Smith told The Washington Post. “Being scared all the time isn’t good for your health. It suppresses your immune system.”

Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.

At one Kentucky gas station, no one is allowed inside the adjacent convenience store if they are wearing a mask. Near Los Angeles, a flooring store encourages hugs and handshakes while prohibiting face coverings. The owner of a campground in rural Wisconsin vowed to treat clients sporting them inside facilities as she would “a robbery in progress.”


Scientific and medical experts agree that people should cover their faces in public to stop the spread of the coronavirus, which has now killed at least 100,000 people in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintain that masks serve as an especially important safeguard in crowded spaces, where social distancing is impossible.

But Smith, who said he did not believe that the virus poses a serious threat, wanted to stir the pot.

For years, he has run his 60-seat bar, which occupies a converted alleyway on Elgin’s main drag, just as he pleases. Smoking is permitted during karaoke nights and performances by local talent, and beers are served in black-and-white koozies that say, “Come and drink it,” playing off the Texan battle flag.


A two-month shutdown from Texas officials had forced him to cancel a benefit concert for veterans and close down during the busy rush of customers that fly in to nearby Austin for South by Southwest. For three weeks, a Bastrop County rule required him to wear a face mask in public or face up to 180 days in jail.

“Why are we having to do this?” he asked. “We’re not here to live in fear.”

Masks become a flash point for protests and fights as businesses, beaches and parks reopen

A town of about 10,000 people, Elgin has reported 53 coronavirus infections and one of the two deaths in the county. Even as local officials continue to encourage residents to cover their faces, Smith said he does not believe masks are necessary.

Bartenders need to see their customers’ faces to check IDs and make sure no one gets served too many drinks, he argued. Anyone with the virus, including those who are asymptomatic, should not be coming out to begin with. Besides, he asked: How are you supposed to down a beer with a bandanna stretched across your lips?

One regular at the Liberty Tree Tavern, 58-year old Charles Chamberlain, said he survived both Stage 4 cancer and the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu. He spent a full year living out of a Houston hospital, he told the Austin American-Statesman, before becoming so frustrated at his isolation that he cut the cancer treatment short.

“This quarantine … That’s not living, that’s existing,” he said. “Going to the bar, going to the lake, going swimming with your friends, barbecuing, fishing — that’s living.”

Smith, who also ranches cattle, said his customers have social distancing built into their rural lifestyle. For now, the regulars don’t seem to mind his request. No one had been kicked out yet for disobeying the poster, and one customer’s son, who has intellectual disabilities, was allowed to keep his mask on.


Chamberlain, who has been out to the Liberty Tree Tavern about three times since it reopened, plans to keep coming back.

“You should have a choice of what you want to do,” he told the Statesman. “If I get it, I get it. If I do, I’ll deal with that. You can’t live forever.”",1590669737,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gs54cb/sorry_no_mask_allowed_some_businesses_pledge_to/fs30cqr/,concert,2020-05-28

zkat21,"This is the issue with the ""We can just open everything up and resume normal economic and social participation in life by everyone if everyone wears a mask"" theory. Masks are uncomfortable for prolonged periods of time and that leads a lot of people to not wear them consistently and correctly. It may be tolerable to wear a mask for a short haircut or a brief run into Target, but that doesn't mean it's easy for the employees who have to do it for hours and hours. 

And can people reasonably do activities like trying on clothes in a dressing room, going to a concert, a movie, or an amusement park, go on a long flight, eating at a restaurant, etc. with a mask? Will they do them with a mask? My guess is that most people will find the experience frustratingly diminished and will just choose to stay home 

Masks and/or moving as many activities outside as possible are really good stop gaps right now. But they are not a recipe for a ""new normal"" and we shouldn't delude ourselves of that.

BubbleTee,"Schools and office buildings can't be compared to things like concerts and conventions.

In a school or office building, you only have close contact with the same group of people on a regular basis. It's sedentary and people are quiet for the majority of that time. Compare this to events like concerts where people are jumping up and down, singing along to the music, screaming and moving through a packed crowd. It's pretty clear that one positive person at a concert will infect more than one person at a workplace. The crowd at a concert would also be more difficult to contact trace, if it's possible at all.

Schools and workplaces are somewhat necessary. I would definitely advocate for an option to telecommute for a while, and let each family assess the risk for themselves. It would be great if we could get to a point where we could test students regularly - it wouldn't catch all cases but would definitely help. Every family has different circumstances. Obviously, there are some fields in which telecommuting is not an option. Those employees face a tough choice, unfortunately.

Lecture classes at universities, same thing. Allow a remote learning option for students and instructors. Some will take it and some will not.

I don’t think you can replicate the concert/bar atmosphere with VR. It’s a social experience—getting dinner, drinks (also not VR-compatible) with friends and meeting new people. There’s also something about being physically near the artist that’s irreplaceable. 

There might be some small changes in the way people spread germs, but I doubt it (and I note that all of your examples survived worse pandemics).  People really like most of your food examples and it will be hard to get them to permanently give them up, given the risk is low when we’re not in the middle of a pandemic.  I could imagine handshakes going away, but I don’t think they will. I think even more extreme forms of physical contact will remain.  For example, people will continue to hug their friends hello/goodbye.  People will continue to make out with people they just met at the bar.  And so on and so forth.

Likewise, if a very popular venue is a city landmark or has historical significance, I would hope cities act to save the space for future use.

blublblubblub,"Main findings

1. Based on the cases we  studied, we are confident that regardless of the culture, healthcare  system, or geographic location in question, **a Google search peak  preceded the contagion downward changepoint in the recovering countries**.  These peaks even seemed to predict the containment of the contagion in  the countries, although the speed and strength of the influence of this  information on the population depends on many political and  communication variables and on the way the citizenry responds in each  country.
2. Although it would be necessary to identify new  cases to underscore this point, the Chilean case suggests that the big  increase in Google searches is linked to an increase in people’s  concern, in their management of information about the virus and in the  development of preventive behaviours (including changes in mobility  patterns). The joint manifestation of all these elements would explain  their association with a greater containment of this pandemic.
3. Our  findings might have public policy and crisis management applications.  The Google search peak could be used as a proxy for citizens’ concerns  and their response level, giving some guidance to both policy- and  decision-makers. Of course, it is not a very detailed indicator, but it  is fast, cheap and already available for use by any government.  Moreover, it can be used at a more detailed level, allowing the analysis  of patterns in regions within countries.
4. Today the world is  facing an unprecedented crisis that is also challenging traditional  methods of social research. Greater adoption of digital methods seems to  be an appropriate response to this crisis. These methods are safer (in  terms of preventing infection), faster, more accessible and much cheaper  than traditional ones. However, we must be extremely cautious about  protecting privacy rights.

I don't recall if there were allegations that the US was putting symptomatic patients on board, not testing, or what. I simply don't recall. I _believe_ on the US ""testing"" simply meant a fever check. I do know that one specific concern Guatemala had was that the US was reluctant to even use PPE or space deportees out sufficiently. From Guatemala's standpoint, stuffing healthy people and sick people on a plane was putting their citizens at risk.

As an interesting side note, you know who was doing at least some (and I suspect a fair bit) of the testing once deportees were in Guatemala City? The US CDC. Kind of interesting.

As you pointed out, yes, the US took back their own citizens. You will recall they the highest risk US citizens were flown back by the US in tightly controlled conditions. The hope was to help prevent spread on the planes. The deportees are similarly high risk. COVID easily spreads in prisons.

IamPezu,"&gt;What kind of evidence are you expecting? The virus has not been around long enough to have any evidence on long-term effects. 

So, as the WHO would say,  ""There is no evidence Covid-19 causes long term damage.""

&gt; The concern comes from ~~the amount of damage the virus does to the lungs and potentially blood vessels, kidneys, and everything else. Extensive injury to any part of the body 1. takes a very long time to heal and 2. can result in scarring. Scar tissue does not function as it was intended to function before the injury. Additionally,  even if  someone recovers to their pre-COVID-19 level of functioning, there is no way to know if their damaged lungs will shorten their expected lifespan by 10 years unless enough people have gotten COVID-19, lived a seemingly long life, died, then a study was done to compare the average life span of people who had COVID-19 to those who didn't. Simply put, long-term studies can only be done after a long time has passed.~~

RogueDevlin,"Yes, testing could be done. 

The government does not want to, for a lot of reasons.  

First, the man in charge (Lopez Gatell) holds a grudge when he was fired during the H1N1 break, because the president at the time did not accept his Sentinel method to count the cases, and discovered a lot of inconsistencies with his data.  

The current president loaths that previous president, so he put the fired guy in charge with his Sentinel method.  

Testing everyone will prove that the measures taken by the government were irresponsible and late. 

It was mid March when government offices were sending  out visual communication staying there was nothing to worry about. They allowed a large concert in Mexico City (Vive Latino). The president himself posted a video on his Twitter telling the people to go out and enjoy restaurants. He was touring the country, rallying people and greeting and kissing everyone. In March!  

It is not completely true that we pay everything out of the pocket. There is social security for a lot of people. But in another idiotic move, the president disappeared the Seguro Popular for people that could not apply to any health benefits and changed it to his own model. The system was in chaos when the pandemic hit. Contracts for medicines has been halted with laboratories.  

The government also decided to sell a lot of facemasks to China in February, which now they say, it may have been a mistake. But at the same time Lopez Gatell was continuously regarded the use of facemasks as not necessary and to significant for every day use.  

And last, the government has made it clear their only concern is the Oil, the Mayan Train, the populist handouts and baseball. Fundings are going towards that. There has been almost zero stimulus to companies or to people who have lost their jobs.  

Going specific intro testing, the government initially centralized all nationwide testing in one institute in Mexico City. Slow and ineffective process. The government forbade private labs and hospitals  to do tests. And the criteria was very specific. It took more than a month for other labs and hospitals to start testingd the requirements were still very strict.  

At this point, the data presented in the daily conferences, does not include the results of people being tested in private labs.

SizzleInGreen,"Not sure we have had the motivation previously.  I’m afraid of the (as far as what I’m aware) poor history of rushed vaccines.  My question was just face value though, odd it was downvoted, I think the answer is helpful and would help formulate my opinion on what is truly going to be a big decision.  Are successful vaccines (because there as certainly great ones with minimal side effects) typically slow to the public because the testing phase is unreasonable or because the development takes long?  Understanding that convoluted testing and time trials are probably for the best (again, dangerous past), how many of the successful vaccines we have were quickly developed in labs and simply held up for a long time in testing?  I’m hoping someone with knowledge can point out that x and y vaccines were developed in a month, they just were held up for 5 years and eventually rolled to the public with no ill effects... that would ease my concern.

What I do know is that the quickest vaccine to market was for mumps I believe, and took several years.  It was also successful and safe I believe.  

I am concerned about a vaccine rolled out before the year is up.  Vaccine side effects could be catastrophic if not properly tested... and just like I agree we should be on a stricter version of lock down to save lives during this pandemic, I think it behooves is to show patience (if possible) in developing a safe vaccine, again to save and not risk lives.

I think it will be hypocritical and curious to see many of the same people harping for stricter lock down adherence (in the name of every life we save matters), admonishing those who are reluctant to take a quickly available vaccine (which is in the same spirit).",1590238564,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gop5j8/the_coronavirus_vaccine_is_on_track_to_be_the/frjntgy/,concern,2020-05-23

I heard my cousin's best friends sister in law (yeah, really that distant) died from it. So, while I follow the news and am objectively horrified at the amount of deaths across the country, (and world),  it's so hard to put it into a personal loss perspective, since it's not happening around me directly.

DeanBlandino,"She makes three allegations:

1. A senior official asked for the entire dashboard to be taken offline because it provided too much data

2. She was asked to massage the data for specific rural counties so that they met the statistical criteria to re-open

3. The state has changed the way COVID-19 testing positivity rates are calculated to better suit the governor's arguments

You can read her blog post where she refutes the governor's claims (which was picked up in various articles that some people liked to share on reddit). Most of his claims were ridiculous on their face, but she addresses them in turn. One of his claims is that she's not a ""data scientist.""

&gt;""While no one operates without the support of their team, I was the sole architect and manager of the dashboard and its published underlying data. I wrote the script in R to pull, analyze, process and format the raw data from queried data in Merlin, which is the case database managed by epidemiologists and data scientists working tirelessly across the state. I processed hundreds of thousands of lines of raw data to produce the data I published on the dashboard and on the DOH website. Working with a developer from ESRI, I wrote the Python code to push the data from our secure servers to our web interface. I designed the public- facing dashboard literally and completely alone.  Every box, every graphic and chart, all of the maps, the API feeds, the Open Data Hub that housed the data, the HTML to customize the dashboard, all built by me and me alone""

..

&gt;""I used skills learned through my bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral studies in climate science, geospatial science and communications to take raw data, analyze it, prepare and format it, and publish it""

..

&gt;""I received national acclaim for my work on the dashboard, including an article featured on the website of ESRI, the software company used for all of our GIS analysis and research projects. Dr.  Deborah Birx praised my dashboard in multiple interviews. My dashboard was being hailed by FEMA as a shining example of effective communication and data transparency.""

Imo her biggest allegation is after a lengthy defense of the work she put in.

&gt;""**The Deputy Secretary of Health, Shamarial Roberson, asked me to manipulate and delete data in late April as work for the state’s reopening plan started to take off,  and she is the one who ordered me off the dashboard and fired me when I objected to repeated requests to manually alter, hide and delete public data.  All of this is provable through email and texts, which are subject to public records request.**""

DeSantis said she was not fired for refusing to manipulate data, but for her insubordination- that she refused to follow the orders of an epidemiologist to correct bad data. Her response:

&gt;Scott Pritchard, one of the epidemiologists on our response team, asked me on May 4 to hide all of the data from the public and make it inaccessible for anyone to download and, consequently, analyze or check for accuracy. As the manager of Geographic Information Science for all of the Florida Department of Health,  Pritchard was never in a position of authority over me.  When I pushed back, stating plainly that transparency was something I worked very hard for on my dashboard, Pritchard went around me and asked my supervisor to order me to delete and hide the data. When I received that instruction, I did as ordered, but not without voicing my concern and disagreement beforehand. Once they realized how much of a mistake it was to intentionally hide and delete data, they asked me to put it back up, and I did so immediately, without any data being altered or changed in any way.  No question about the data’s accuracy was ever brought to my attention, as Pritchard clearly stated that the data wasn’t wrong, he just didn’t want to have to answer questions about it that would make him,  DOH or the state look bad.

..

&gt;The only directive I refused was to manually change data in a misleading way to drum up public support of resuming pre-pandemic level of activities without a science- based assessment of each county’s respective risk or readiness to do so.  The request to mislead the public with falsified data made me uneasy, and I immediately reached out to my supervisor, as well as my friends and family, about what happened.  It was no secret in our office that Shamarial Roberson asked me to compromise my integrity and use my dashboard to mislead the public about the safety of reopening each county.

This is in response to DeSantis's claims on why he fired her:

&gt;""One, she is not a data scientist. She is somebody that’s got a degree in journalism, communication and geography. She is not involved in collating any data, she does not have the expertise to do that, she is not an epidemiologist, she is not the chief architect of our web portal. That is another false statement,"" the governor said. ""She was putting data on the portal, which the scientists didn't believe was valid data.

bionista,This is not entirely fair and is a bit of a deflection on the part of the Oxford team. The concern raised by Haseltine is legit in that it’s disappointing the vaccine did not eliminate the virus from the monkey. It prevented pneumonia which probably prevents serious disease but it did not fully protect against the virus which may mean it can be transmitted or can cause other non-pneumonia damage. This is independent of how it performed vs the other vaccines.,1590274298,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gpdssi/oxford_university_covid19_vaccine_trial_has_only/frld6q4/,concern,2020-05-23
ILoveKombucha,"Too many people act like the government is keeping everything closed and hurting the economy in the process.   My understanding is that people were already locking themselves down before the official measures (self included, for sure!), and a solid majority of people aren't going to go back to gyms or restaurants or movie theaters, even if those places are reopened.   

The economy is pretty well screwed no matter how you slice it.   It's all mitigation strategies at this point... and in the US, we have a government that is reluctant to do much more to mitigate the economic damage (apparently being more worried about people free-riding off of any benefits they might get, than people being economically ruined by this pandemic).   

Aside from that, I'm not against sensible steps to re-open the economy, but I don't think it's a black and white issue of OPEN vs CLOSED.   There are various degrees along the way (really, in a lot of ways, we weren't all that locked down to begin with; it could have been far more strict).   

Our re-opening strategies must keep safety as the highest concern.   

In the meantime, if more of the anti-lockdown people were promoting mask usage instead of acting like it's anti-freedom and anti-America, we might get things even better under control and in a shorter amount of time, which could only help the economy and efforts to re-open.   Throwing a mask on is one of the most low-effort things a person can do, and apparently fairly effective.",1590274598,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gpcj0c/america_begins_to_unlock_for_summer_but_is_it/frldpxd/,concern,2020-05-23

It’s not like it’s our food which can get kinda iffy traveling. Pizza can go right in the oven. Like there’s no good reason to open dine in at all but especially not for some chain pizza :( Does your model market themselves and being um highly customizable pizza? 

One of our local businesses came under fire for not letting staff wear PPE. The staff told their friends who then put them on blast on their IG and Yelp. It looked like it worked. Maybe you can get others to speak on your behalf or encourage people to express concern to the managers that they no longer feel safe getting takeout if the staff aren’t masked. Shit—I would even reach out for you. Any way to frame it so that it becomes a matter of public perception and guest health concerns affecting sales...that’s the best I got. Maybe tell your manager that a guest asked why you weren’t masked? Hillstone Group in Texas won’t let staff wear masks, but lots of people used their contact form and gave them hell. Unfortunately, they still can’t wear masks but they did remove their contact form.

AgentOrcish,"There will be a collapse of civil services if the economy gets worse. Local and state economies are not getting tax revenue. They are under water. Less tax revenue leads to layoffs in court systems, fire companies, police departments, utility workers, judges, teachers, school administrators. 
Most schools are going to ask teachers to take less pay next year. The teacher Unions are already getting ready for a fight. I know for a fact the most schools are facing budget deficits in the millions starting July 1, 2020. 

That leads to discussions of what to cut... arts? Sports? Band? Parents are going to lose their shit if they don’t get their Friday night Lights! I know this may sound silly, but high school football and sports in general will be a huge sense of normalcy in the Fall. Without it, communities will be depressed. I was. Ever a fan, but as someone who gets dragged to the games, I now can respect what a Friday night game does for the community. 

Parents are complaining about educating their kids...I have news for them, if teachers have to take less pay and strike, you’ll be teaching your kids full time in the Fall. They will be home with you. The CDC regulations over education and schools did not take in mind the schools budget deficits and teacher unions. Those two obstacles are going to throw a giant wrench in those plans. 

If cops get laid off, you better arm your household because the unemployed and hungry will come to your house. State unemployment systems were not made to withstand the amount of claims that they are seeing now. There will eventually be no money to give. 

Weaker corporations are going under. Hertz, JC Penney, Friendly’s, Ruby Tuesday... this starts a ripple effect because those employees lost those jobs for good. They are not coming into work after this is over. Those jobs are gone. 

That also means less people paying for healthcare, less people able to pay rent for a long time, not just a short period. 

Deflation will kick in. Things will be worth less, but some items will be worth more.

Most countries banned indoor smoking except in ventilated smoking rooms, so second hand smoke is being taken care of bit by bit, if you find yourself in a smoking room, but are a non smoker, who will you blame. I feel for the children of smoking parents, but this is a slippery slope.

Regardless, smoking, alcoholism, overeating... all of those are addictive some mild some severe, if our governments would actually care for those people who want to get help, things would look differently. Usually a box of nicotine patches or nicotine chewing gums costs more than 20 packs of cigarettes, why would smokers buy that and spend more money on those things which might or might not work out for them instead of buying their cigarettes. Anyway, I'm just going to say it here, ever since I moved to Europe with their no-smoking laws, I have no issues with smokers at all. 

As for sports, the same thing. You want people stop ruining themselves by ingesting harmful things, but then again you want them to stop exercising too, kind of paradoxical, and I get where you are coming from, a lot of extreme climbers take unnecessary risks, but that comes with climbing.

Here's a [better link that has text of the interview](https://www.expressen.se/tv/nyheter/coronaviruset/anders-tegnell-klustersmittan-over-sverige-i-ny-fas/):

#Cluster infection no longer exists

&gt;Anders Tegnell, current state epidemiologist in Sweden, looks differently at the strategy to fight the infection locally. 

&gt;- I don't really know what she means, because **we don't see very many clusters in Sweden. And that readiness (to handle cluster infection ed.) Is already there, I would argue. At least in the regions that do not have so many cases, they have control over it. There, you detect infection and stop the infection, he says.**

&gt;A cluster infection spreads in groups and gives more numbers of spots. A cluster can jump from one neighborhood to another. 

&gt;According to Tegnell, the foreign travelers who pulled the infection to Sweden in connection with the sports holiday week are an example of a cluster.

&gt;- **Cluster infection is a known phenomenon with this disease, but compared to many other countries we have probably had much smaller clusters in Sweden, says Tegnell.**

&gt;- **But in Sweden, the infection is no longer spreading in clusters, there are no signs of it.**

wanderlustcub,"So. I’m an American living in New Zealand. 

I lost my job during the Covid lockdown. (Being a contractor for local government, the ended all contracts to tighten the belt. I absolutely agree with them.)

I instantly have received financial support from the government. Not only that, but I also got on a scheme to help with my
Mortgage. Again instantly. 

Both acts, initiated by the government has given me peace of mind as everything been chaotic. I already have job interviews this week, as do several others I know who were let go as we are coming out of lockdown. We will come back. 

Yes, it’s not easy, but the safety net being there is one of the many reasons why people were secure with staying home. And everyone staying calm and collected. I’ll find a new job. I’m glad that people here are not devastated by death. 

 I’m lucky that I live in a nation now that values life over profits. I’m lucky that I have a country who cares about its people. I’m lucky I live in a country that values science and listens to experts.

_Z_E_R_O,"The problem I think isn’t logistics, but psychology.

I grew up in an affluent town and attended several private schools as well as an expensive private religious university with tons of people in that income bracket. Allow me to provide some insight into how these people work. 

300K is the upper bound of middle class. At that level you probably have a pretty good upper management job, a large-ish house, and a family with several kids. And you’re right, it’s very easy to live a comfortable life and save quite a bit on that income. The problem is, it’s almost never that simple. 

To maintain that job you‘ll need to network quite a bit, and in order to network you‘ll need to be in the same places as all of the management at work. Those places are country clubs, the right churches, social organizations, and private schools for your kids. It’s not even an option; at a certain point it’s an expectation. You have a hard social ceiling and will *not* get a promotion if you don’t impress the right people. Full stop. 

The upper class - aka CEOs - really is a society of its own completely separate from the rest of the world, and they want to socialize with people who are like them. These are the types who have full-time personal assistants, get manicures and haircuts from celebrity stylists in their own home, don’t even look at servers at restaurants, and pretend their maid or nanny doesn’t exist. They are almost always men with wives who don’t work, children they never see, and who piss away more than you make in a year in miscellaneous expenses that they barely even know about. People in this class were usually born into wealth and inherited their position, or at the very least networked hard in order to get it. They’ve never done laundry, don’t know how much college tuition costs because grandpa’s trust fund paid for it, have never driver a used car, and have a metal credit card with no limit and a private concierge number they can call any time, day or night. 

Meanwhile here you are with a $300,000 salary. You are an ambitious person and want to succeed in this world. You enroll your kids in the same private school your boss’s kids attends, and they all play on the same sports teams. That alone costs you $50,000 per year. Your families are close and you have cookouts at their lake house. You surprise your wife with a $2,500 Louis Vuitton handbag for her birthday so she can brag about it to boss’s wife. That promotion is *right there,* just around the corner. 

But then your daughter shows up to school in the used Toyota you bought her, and the boss’s son laughs and calls her a poor slut. Your daughter cries, but then you ask if she wants to go to a different school and she cries even harder. You see, the lifestyle you are now providing for your family is addictive, and it doesn’t come cheap. If you take her out of school she’ll have to stop doing the sport she loves so much and say goodbye to all the friends she’s made. She’ll have to stop going to all-expense-paid European vacations with their families and will probably have to say goodbye to the private college she wants to go to.

She keeps driving the Toyota. Boss’s son meanwhile wrecks his brand new car in a drunk driving incident, and is given another one to replace it the next day. Three months later he does it again. None of this matters because their family has enough money that he will never see the inside of a jail cell and will never face any realistic consequences for his actions. There will always be enough money to hire a weaselly lawyer, bail him out, and buy a new car. You lay in bed one night questioning your friendship with their family and wondering if you should backpedal, but then the next day you get the promotion. You take your family to a Caribbean resort for a week to celebrate. 

But it’s not enough. Your family is going deep into debt to pretend to be like these people. You start to wonder if it’s worth it or not, but by now you owe a lot of money and you’ll never be able to pay it off at a lower income level. You’re finally realizing that you made a mistake - you confused rich with wealthy. The $450k a year you now earn is not enough to fraternize with third-generation millionaires and live like they do. Unfortunately the credit card company doesn’t accept regret as payment. 

Your daughter comes home from school beaming and waving her Harvard acceptance letter in your face, and your son pipes up saying that NHL scouts will be at his next hockey tournament so he needs $1,200 in new equipment. You barely hear the words. Your wife comes out of your newly remodeled Italian marble bathroom - that she got at boss’s wife’s insistence and which you financed through yet another loan - and congratulates both of them. 

 Bankruptcy is a very real possibility. You *just need that next promotion.*

And that’s how it happens.",1590367082,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gpn8iu/middleclass_americans_queue_at_food_banks_as_us/frpzz5x/,sports,2020-05-24

2) Let’s say distribution isn’t an issue, then you still have to convince everyone to take it (not like you can force a vaccine on someone). I’m pro-vaccine, but as a young healthy adult I would still be hesitant to take the vaccine right when it comes out because it’ll be the most rushed drug in history. I would rather wait several months or even a year to make sure the vaccine is safe on a mass-level

Trimdon73,"Spectator sports have become what they were never intended to be, particularly football here in England. The whole point was to encourage team work and competition among the players and for the fans the football club was the flagship of the community for the people of the community to get behind. These days there is so much money involved, and according to some of these players they struggle to make ends meet on 200 grand a week and so they need 300 grand a week, that the fans simply can't relate to the players and don't feel like it's their club anymore; and so the traditional football supporter has moved away from the game and middle-class types have filled the gap. I suppose it's entertainment now as opposed to a passion. Mind you, the advent of the commercialisation of the game is nothing to do with distraction or being pacified.

And, it doesn't detract from improving ourselves nor is it 'a corporate pacifier'. This assumes that everyone is stupid. In actual fact, far from being stupid, traditional football fans are well aware of the way the world works and that there are far too many people who endlessly want to go through the left/right false dichotomy, repeating the same mistakes, that doesn't improve anything. Traditional football fans in this country have known for more than a century that politics is a load of nonsense, a big game played by groups of people who simply pick a side as a means to have a verbal, pointless fight. So, really, traditional football fans here have always been far more sceptical than traditional Labour and Conservative voters who will repeat the party line verbatim, make no difference whatsoever, and just fight over nothing. Football fans in England are generally not political, unlike football fans in continental Europe. We realised long ago politics is nonsense, unlike political voters who will argue until they are blue in the face that their side can make a difference, despite evidence/experience to the contrary: those are the people who are making sure the political game continues, nothing changes, and you can't get a straight answer out of them.",1590380725,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gq1ol4/in_the_age_of_coronavirus_were_finding_out_just/frqkyiq/,sports,2020-05-25

However, religious freaks, religious organizations, people refusing to even believe there's a virus out there and business owners not providing safe work conditions were issues we had to deal with throughout the crisis.

Problem is, the Balkans as a whole seems to try to re-open way too soon, Serbia is re-opening their borders soon and unless people show symptoms they're going to be free to come and go as they please. They're ignoring the fact that asymptomatic carries are actually the most dangerous when it comes to spreading the virus.

My country, Macedonia can't do jack to stop religious groups and people from gathering, being a corrupt shithole we have police overlooking blatant law breaking of family gatherings past curfew and such all the time. People don't even wear masks anymore outside, well some do, most do not.

If the whole world just did what Sweden did, hospitals would be overwhelmed. This means triage starts coming into play and people that might have lived, die.

Giles-TheLibrarian,"&gt; [The Trump administration] have tainted the notion that the outbreak began with a lab accident or safety breach.

&gt; “**An open investigation is absolutely warranted and absolutely essential,” said Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University**. A longtime biosafety proponent, Ebright believes that a **lab error is “at least as probable” as an entirely natural spillover event.** “Unsupported claims by Trump and Pompeo have politicized and polarized the issue and likely have had the effect of making an open investigation less likely.”

&gt; **We need to look wider than just the wet market origin,” said Filippa Lentzos, a biosafety expert at King’s College London. “At the moment it’s still an open question**.” The closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2 is a bat coronavirus that was sampled by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but the two viruses are not close enough to suggest a direct link.

&gt; In order to determine what happened, these experts say, the world needs a neutral inquiry untainted by the Trump administration’s efforts to divert attention away from the botched U.S. response. “**The investigation shouldn’t be about apportioning blame,” said Lentzos. “The investigation needs to be about finding a credible answer for how the pandemic started** and then using that to develop an early warning for the future

&gt; If a full investigation is eventually conducted, biosafety experts hope that it will include a review of samples and safety protocols from the Wuhan labs as well as the wet market. Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, said it would be useful to see lab records from Wuhan going back to August, as well as any records from work with other mammalian viruses.

&gt; If it was a breach, we need to know, because then clearly we are overestimating our capacities to contain some of these viruses,” he said. “We need to know this as scientists because if it can infect one scientist then it can infect a third, fourth, fifth.”",1590286678,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gozhad/the_trump_administration_is_thwarting/frlxnde/,protocols,2020-05-23

Yes, this seems to be a major reason why Sweden was able to trumpet its success over avoiding hospital overload, as many had predicted would happen. They simply adjusted the protocols to [deny the elderly sick access to hospitals](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52704836), leaving them to [die in their nursing homes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz5BhX5_CXo) (similar to what Cuomo did in NY and what the Irish gov't did).

It is possible that the cross-reactivity primes the innate immune system so that individuals do not get infected as badly (possibly all the asymptomatic cases).  The can still likely get infected and spread the disease.

JuanConnor,"Close, they are actually condensing negative results from a period where infection rates were lower to periods where they are very likely to be higher. 

Think of it like this: 

The state has said each day for weeks that x people tested today and of them x were positive. This results in a daily infection rate statistic. All of this data, day after day shows a trend of infections going up, down, or staying the same. When we were in quarantine this rate went up fast at the beginning, then more slowly, and then started to level off. 

When we started removing protocols for quarantine, new infections happened as there was more exposure to spread the virus. This is fact. This will show in the infection rate data within 14 days IF the data is reported consistently. This new infection rate is an important tool to indicate if we’re moving too fast with our return to normal. 

This is where FL comes in... the state started giving more tests each day than they could actually process. This created a backlog that was reported in a series of “dumps” over at least two days. Rather than the data being used to modify the rate for the date the test happened, it was issued to a new day. This mean result from the PAST were being used as an indicator for data for a different day. 

This is problematic because yesterdays data isn’t today’s data. It’s dangerous because the quarantine slowed the spread of infection and we rely on this data to show what the actual infection rate is for any given day. 

The manipulation takes advantage of how there are fewer positives between 1-14 days of exposure because of the delay to test positive after becoming infected. “Dumping” old data into present dilutes positives and significantly skews the numbers to show an artificially low rate of infection.",1590358408,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gpxolz/fl_is_not_even_concealing_their_covid_19_data/frplat9/,protocols,2020-05-24

The shifts in case numbers takes several weeks to occur, and most places (in the US at least) have only been reopened for maybe 2 weeks. People don’t seem to really understand that it takes a long time for this to play out. One example of a potential second wave is in China. This week the government locked down nearly 110 million more people do to cases popping up in the Jilin province. For comparison, ~57 million were locked down in Hubei. Since the beginning, China seems to foreshadow what is to come in other countries. If a second wave is beginning in China, the country with the strongest pandemic response on the planet, we should not discount the possibility of it happening anywhere else. Especially when other places are not upholding their safety protocols like China is.

  INTERNATIONAL 🔴 ITALY 🇮🇹 🙏
  IN ITALY THE CURE FOR THE CORONAVIRUS IS FINALLY FOUND.

  Italian doctors, disobeyed the world health law WHO, not to do autopsies on the dead of the Coronavirus and they found that it is NOT a VIRUS but a BACTERIA that causes death.  This causes blood clots to form and causes the death of the patient.

  🔷Italy defeats the so-called Covid-19, which is nothing other than ""Disseminated intravascular coagulation"" (Thrombosis).

  🔷And the way to combat it, that is, its cure, is with the “antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants”.  ASPIRIN, indicating that this disease had been poorly treated.
  This sensational news for the world has been produced by Italian doctors by performing autopsies on corpses produced by the Covid-19.

  🔷Something else, according to Italian pathologists.  ""The ventilators and the intensive care unit were never needed.""

  🔷Therefore in Italy the change of protocols began, ITALY THE SO-CALLED global pandemic is REVEALED AND RAISED BY THE WHO, this cure the Chinese already knew and did not report FOR DOING BUSINESS.

  If they get to contract the Covid-19 ... which is not a Virus as they have made us believe, but a bacterium ... amplified with 5G electromagnetic radiation that also produces inflammation and hypoxia.
  They will do the following:
  They are going to take Aspirin 100mg and Apronax or Paracetamol ...
  Why? ... because it has been shown that what Covid-19 does is to clot the blood, causing the person to develop a thrombosis and the blood not to flow and not oxygenate the heart and lungs and the person to die quickly due to not  be able to breathe.
  In Italy they screwed up the WHO protocol and did an autopsy on a corpse that died from Covid-19 ... they cut the body and opened the arms and legs and the other sections of the body and realized that the veins were  dilated and coagulated blood and all veins and arteries filled with thrombi, preventing the blood from flowing normally and bringing oxygen to all organs, mainly to the brain, heart and lungs and the patient ends up dying,
  Already knowing this diagnosis, the Italian Ministry of Health immediately changed the Covid-19 treatment protocols ... and began to administer to their positive patients Aspirin 100mg and Apronax ..., result: the patients began to recover and present  improvements and the Ministry of Health released and sent home more than 14,000 patients in a single day.
  URGENT: transmit this information and make it viral, here in our country they have lied to us, with this pandemic, the only thing that our president comes out to say every day is data and statistics but not giving this information to save citizens, will be that  It will also be threatened by the elites? ... we do not know, suddenly all the governments of the world, but Italy broke the norm ... because they were already overwhelmed and in serious chaos of daily deaths ..., now the WHO.  ... would be sued worldwide for covering up so many deaths and the collapse of the economies of many countries in the world ... now it is understood why the order to INCINERATE or immediately bury the bodies without autopsy ... and labeled them as highly polluting ..  .
  It is in our hands to carry the truth and hope to save many lives .... SPREAD IN ALL NETWORKS URGENT !!!!!  that's why the antibacterial gel works and the chlorine dioxide ... The whole PANDEMIC is because they want to vaccinate and kick to assassinate the masses to control them and reduce the World Population

Background, I’m in the northeast (back to work for two weeks, lots of work precautions.) I have taken this whole thing very seriously and I feel I owe it to my customers to do so. Frankly, my protocols at my office are overkill, but I think if that reduces people’s anxiety it’s worth it so they can relax knowing that I’m very careful. Now, to the point, I can’t say you specifically but 100% for sure people who had your viewpoint of this pandemic and how to handle it were definitely saying that Georgia was going to be overrun with covid when they reopened over a month ago...same thing with Florida...

Yeah, we can say “probably humidity and sunlight, could be vitamin D in population, could be xyz”...but the fact is the doomsday this sub said GA/FL were heading for simply never occurred.

I would be curious what ""lots of precautions"" mean very very specifically.

&gt; Frankly, my protocols at my office are overkill, but I think if that reduces people’s anxiety it’s worth it so they can relax knowing that I’m very careful.

I just want to point out that this is, thus far, an unsupported conclusion. I am definitely not trying to fence with you as you seem inherently reasonable in your questions and post. I just want to say that if you are asking me for an (internet) professional* opinion, then I would say that I would need to know what the protocols are; I would have to know more about the nature of the work; what the environmental and physical setup of the office or worksite is like; the size of staffing compliment, etc., in order to be able to speak on whether it is insufficient, sufficient, or overkill as you paint it.

&gt;&gt;Georgia was going to be overrun with covid when they reopened over a month ago...same thing with Florida... But it simply hasn’t happened. So, essentially, the question is...how can you even say that the data you’re basing your opinion on (which I even share to some degree) is accurate?

First on the USA as a whole. The numbers are being gamed and you can't trust them depending on where they are from. I am not making this up nor am I a conspiracy theorist. There is a story every day about a State or a Corporation that is not going to be reporting their COVID deaths, or the definition of a COVID death has changed. All that said, I will still address your question. The virus is still coming for these states. Or it's there and the message is being filtered, but probably not for long (the internal control person in me knows that secrets have a shelf life). I am Canadian so I don't have a horse in the game per se, but the current administration in your government is not the most forthright, to put it mildly. I personally don't think Georgia or Florida will be spared. The virus has been predictable and consistent across multiple jurisdictions. Sweden tried to hug the virus to death with blonde hair and that resulted in a 10x infection rate. I currently do not accept that there is anything particularly special about Florida or Georgia. I suppose time will tell, maybe there is a miracle vector (my smoker friends keep telling me they read that nicotine will save their lungs from Covid) so who knows. What I can say with some conviction is that there have definitely been places where social distancing seems to have worked in that the medical systems are not maxing out. There is probably a point of critical mass that the virus achieves where enough people have it or spread it to a point that an exponential self-sustaining process begins.

 
&gt; Yeah, we can say “probably humidity and sunlight, could be vitamin D in population, could be xyz”...but the fact is the doomsday this sub said GA/FL were heading for simply never occurred.

No, I'm not saying anything about sunlight or vitamin D, I am saying look at all those other countries or cities and ask yourself why you think you're so special? (Not being mean, but really, I am trying to push you.) I don't think you can make this call right now. The curves are all headed up. I think time will demonstrate sadly what is plain to many. This highly contagious deadly virus, having killed hundreds of thousands so far, is still out there and will kill more still.

&gt; a pragmatic data nerd standpoint how can you say your favoring such a strict lockdown is even effective (to the point of being worth the massive cost of lives and catastrophic economic damages) 

Well, I never made this argument about the economics of it all, but I might after. First, I simply answered the question that is apparently perplexing to many. I just want to make sure people know why these people are dying and why they will die. It isn't some crazy complicated thing. So after, when it is like 500,000 or 1 Million Americans dead (I know, total bullshit crazy, never happens, not even close, yada yada yada) I am just saying it was never a mystery. It was that time Karen had dinner with her friends and one of the guys was cheating on his girlfriend and he contracted it from that. He was asymptomatic as possibly 50% of infected are and he gives it to all of them.. None of them are SUPER tight about their social isolation and several of them are visiting family members. Well, one of them has diabetes and another one was on prednisone for a heart issue and they both die. Karen and her friends killed them. Of course there are going to be many more examples which are more frequent from the night clubs or the swim up pool bars, etc., but it doesn't change anything about the way the virus can spread, and does.

&gt;&gt;when we have CLEAR examples of state of 10,000,000+ people staying open, often largely ignoring masks, etc and they aren’t trending upwards at all?

I don't think you can conclude on a trend at this point. Given we know they are gaming the numbers, this calls any conclusion further into question. But look, if I take everything you say at face value, we can have that chat about how many lives are worth doing what for. I was just telling people about what we know about the coronavirus and how it is spread and why public health has issued their instructions.

As for hospital administrators it differs, in Germany you already have protocols that restrict what a doctor can do once she's pregnant, like no contact with pacients with hepatitis or some operations involving contact with blood, even forbidden from night shifts.

2. The number you cite is an outlier.  70k does NOT happen most years, or even come close to it.  Also, we get to those numbers with absolutely no social distancing of any kind.  Here with covid, we have extensive social distancing and lock downs, but have amassed over over 100k in deaths in only two months.  Let me summarize: Covid:  2 months with total lockdown - 100k deaths. Flu:  A full year with no social distancing in one of the worst flu seasons in modern times - 70k deaths.  Just think about that.
3. We could potentially have BOTH the flu AND covid running at the same time.  Our health care system is NOT equipped to deal with that.  If we aren't careful, this will could cause many more deaths by the way of an overloaded hospital system that can't adequately handle the load.

And regarding the increased mortality from HCQ. Yes, giving these drugs to already seriously ill patients would most likely be bad for them. Since the virus can spread and attack multiple organs through the ACE2 and CD147 receptors the heart can be one of them. And giving a drug that causes QT-prolongation to someone whose heart is attacked by covid-19 is a bad combination. It again speaks to the timing of HCQ administration.

AttackFriend,"&gt;My priority is preventing myself being infected when I go out, and a piece of cotton across my face is doing very little to address that. I've yet to hear any solutions to this elephant in the room.

Here is your requested solution. Do not go out unless absolutely necessary. If the need arises to go out, please ensure all proper safety protocols are followed on your journey. Due to the asymptomatic nature of this virus, please ensure that your cotton mask (N95 certified masks should be reserved for First Responders and Health Care workers where high risk of infection is certain) is secured properly on your face, taking great care to ensure your mouth and nose are covered to prevent infection spread to others. After your mask has been secured, do not touch your face under any circumstance.  Follow all social distancing procedures posted at the establishment you are visiting, and at the bare minimum remain at least 6 feet from fellow humans. If this can not be followed, or there is not 6 feet between you and another, please vacate the facility or wait in a safe area until a 6 foot distance between others can be obtained. After completion of said journey, and upon your arrival at your place of residence, immediately remove all clothing exposed to outside wear and wash/dry them while again taking care not to touch your face. After removing clothing, immediately wash your hands for at least 20 seconds using soap and warm water, as hot as you can stand preferably.

If you feel the above procedures can not be followed, or you feel like you are at a higher risk of contracting the virus due to circumstances beyond your control, please take necessary precautions to ensure that a family member or guardian can provide you with required necessities during these uncertain times. Should you have any further questions or concerns, please contact your chosen medical representative for further guidance.

megano998,"Full Conclusion:  

 The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has reinforced the need for diligent attention to infection control, especially in ophthalmology  and other outpatient healthcare related settings.  Strict adherence to the use of physical barriers, spatial separation, and PPE are important aspects of any control program.  In addition, chemical antisepsis remains a critical tool in the decontamination of fomites and surfaces, including surfaces found on patients and healthcare workers themselves.  The nasal cavities, nasopharynx, oral cavity, and oropharynx of infected individuals all demonstrate high viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 and are principal reservoirs for the virus. There is a growing interest for decontamination of these areas in patients and healthcare workers to prevent virus transmission. PVP-I is of primary interest due to its ability to inactivate a broad range of pathogens, lack of microbial resistance, and long history of clinical use.  The antimicrobial efficacy of  PVP-I is highly dependent on the organism being eradicated, the PVP-I concentration and the antiseptic contact time.  Though PVP-I has been shown to be a potent and broad virucidal agent active against even other members of the coronavirus family, specific activity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus had not been previously reported.  The data reported here demonstrate the in vitro efficacy of PVP-I nasal and oral preparations specifically developed for use in the nasal passages, nasopharynx and oral cavities.  Moreover, the antiseptics studied are rapidly virucidal at concentrations suitable for safe administration to the nasal and oral mucosa.  Additional studies evaluating these formulations at contact times less than 60 seconds are being conducted to determine the range of exposure times over which virucidal activity is observed.  The efficacy of these nasal and oral antiseptics against SARS-CoV-2 may support their use as additional hygiene measures in the COVID-19 outbreak.  Additionally, the adoption of healthcare specific protocols utilizing PVP-I as an oral rinse and/or intranasally may be useful in decreasing viral burden in the outpatient setting.",1590540899,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gr9d68/in_vitro_efficacy_of_povidoneiodine_nasal_and/frxizv0/,protocols,2020-05-26

Alarmed by a rising number of coronavirus infections among meatpacking workers in Vernon, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday gave local health officials and plant operators one week to review worker safety protocols and report back.

The order, introduced by Supervisor Hilda Solis and passed by a 5-0 vote, followed reports this weekend of coronavirus clusters in at least nine facilities in the small industrial city south of downtown Los Angeles, including five meatpacking plants.

“I was very alarmed about what I heard, and thought, ‘What the heck is going on?’” Solis said in an interview after the supervisors’ Tuesday meeting.

According to county health officials, the largest outbreak was at the Smithfield Foods-owned Farmer John plant, which produces the Dodger Dog. There, 153 of 1,837 employees tested positive for COVID-19 between March and May, county officials said.


More than 200 workers have tested positive across the nine facilities, reflecting a broader national trend in which industrial workers, particularly those in the food industry, have been hit hard by the pandemic.

On Monday, the union that represents workers at the Farmer John plant called for it to be shuttered for cleaning and a review of protocols to keep workers safe. The company has said it already has taken measures to keep employees safe that exceed recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In its motion Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors ordered personnel in the county’s health department to work with city and union officials and the plant operators to outline the efforts that have been taken already, as well as any programs to support workers, their families and the broader Southeast Los Angeles community being impacted by the outbreaks.

They also ordered a review of city and county jurisdiction over the Vernon facilities, and to assess whether current protocols for reducing outbreaks are appropriate.

“I’m not coming as a bully or anything like that,” Solis said. “It’s about trying to resolve this challenge that we have.”

In a statement, the city of Vernon said it “will continue to do everything in its power to work with all parties involved to ensure compliance and safety.”

Smithfield did not respond to a request for comment on the board’s motion.

Solis said she has spoken to UFCW Local 770 union officials who represent workers in the company’s Vernon plant, and agreed with them that more information about control measures within the facilities is needed.

She also said more clarity is needed as to which government entities have oversight over such measures, and other issues related to addressing the current threat.

While Vernon has its own health department, it lacks the capacity to respond to such a major crisis and can’t provide the sort of contact tracing needed to ensure large clusters of a highly contagious virus don’t spread more widely into the surrounding communities, Solis said.

“We’re going to do what we can to try to protect the workers and set better standards,” Solis said.",1590612400,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/grq6b1/ca_what_the_heck_is_going_on_county_supervisors/fs0n4t8/,protocols,2020-05-27

This dilemma cannot be solved in an ethical framework. Yet, protocols have been created for this, and they call for a hard decision to be made. Those are practical (economical) decisions.

Same with this pandemic: saving the 90 year old is not the only question. We know there are lives in balance. It would be disingenuous to claim that the only side effect of lockdowns is clear skies and less pollution.

It is entirely possible to maintain this separation, and what we've recently learned helps make this clear (it isn't early March, we know more than we did then).

The fact that surface transmission is negligible and outdoor transmission is severely limited helps with this.

We can arrange for distancing with exercise (grandma does not need to crowd into a gym with grandpa and all their friends). Social interaction can be limited or distanced.

We do all of that, we can successfully move to an age-targeted lockdown and get many people back to normal life while still limiting deaths.

The government paid nursing homes to take Covid infected seniors from hospitals.

https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/the-massacre-of-italy-s-elderly-nursing-home-residents-35575

&gt;""We were forbidden to wear masks because they told us we would have frightened the guests of the structure,"" continues Pietro La Grassa, ""our hosts saw their relatives with masks, on television they heard that the epidemic kills them above all, yet health workers were forbidden to wear protection."" 
&gt;  
&gt;According to Luca Degani, orders for PPE were seized and diverted from nursing homes to hospitals.
&gt;  
&gt;The result is that today in Trivulzio some 220 workers out of just over 600 are on sick leave with symptoms, fever or cough and some with pneumonia. 

So along with the homes just becoming dangerous to the workers, they became infection centers there as well.  Care workers dont have a lot of money, and they couldnt not work, so they kept working in these terrible environments. And then they got infected and took that out of the nursing homes.

How f*cked up is that?

I see similar situations in many countries.  And interestingly, many of the countries that havent suffered as much are also ones who take care of their parents at home instead of having the same nursing home situation.

I'm not saying nursing homes are the *only* factor in this, but when you consider the amount of deaths there, as well as the fact that so many workers were getting infected and taking that out of the homes, it certainly seems like it might be a BIG chunk of what we know as ""The Covid Crisis"" might be centered around that situation.

Of course it is not in the best interest of the governments to promote that story, so I am not surprised that it is being spun a little differently.

But I really do think that if proper protection and protocols were implemented in a targeted way, where they were needed most, that we could have gone through Covid without shutting down.  For healthy people, Covid just doesnt pose much of a threat.  Not *so* much more than ""bad flu"".  

If Covid had been allowed to pass through a country, while protecting the vulnerable, you would see something like ""bad flu season"" deaths. At that point you get to herd immunity and you end up with a situation like pneumonia. ie - Dont let it get into a senior's home and if it does, take decisive action.

I really think the failure of government to protect seniors and vulnerable populations, and more than that, their policies that *made it worse* for those people, is one of the major driving forces (if not THE driving force) behind what we have seen with Covid.

SpacemanSpiff99,"Here in NJ we're just cracking the door a bit. Beaches are open but no swimming or groups, and there's still no short term rentals so hopefully that discourages people from coming this weekend. We also still have a requirement for masks, and reduced capacity. Non essential retail can only do curbside as of now, which is also a good way to ease some places open. I live right in the shore area and generally am not a fan of the rude tourists that come, but this time I actively see out of state plates and think 'why the fuck are you here?'. A decent chunk of our new numbers are from nursing homes, where it's still spreading pretty fast (no thanks to facilities having to take covid positive patients back).

So I guess we'll see how things go in the neft 3 or so weeks when we can see what comes of this weekend with our slightly lifted restrictions.

AgentOrcish,"There will be a collapse of civil services if the economy gets worse. Local and state economies are not getting tax revenue. They are under water. Less tax revenue leads to layoffs in court systems, fire companies, police departments, utility workers, judges, teachers, school administrators. 
Most schools are going to ask teachers to take less pay next year. The teacher Unions are already getting ready for a fight. I know for a fact the most schools are facing budget deficits in the millions starting July 1, 2020. 

That leads to discussions of what to cut... arts? Sports? Band? Parents are going to lose their shit if they don’t get their Friday night Lights! I know this may sound silly, but high school football and sports in general will be a huge sense of normalcy in the Fall. Without it, communities will be depressed. I was. Ever a fan, but as someone who gets dragged to the games, I now can respect what a Friday night game does for the community. 

Parents are complaining about educating their kids...I have news for them, if teachers have to take less pay and strike, you’ll be teaching your kids full time in the Fall. They will be home with you. The CDC regulations over education and schools did not take in mind the schools budget deficits and teacher unions. Those two obstacles are going to throw a giant wrench in those plans. 

If cops get laid off, you better arm your household because the unemployed and hungry will come to your house. State unemployment systems were not made to withstand the amount of claims that they are seeing now. There will eventually be no money to give. 

Weaker corporations are going under. Hertz, JC Penney, Friendly’s, Ruby Tuesday... this starts a ripple effect because those employees lost those jobs for good. They are not coming into work after this is over. Those jobs are gone. 

That also means less people paying for healthcare, less people able to pay rent for a long time, not just a short period. 

Deflation will kick in. Things will be worth less, but some items will be worth more. 

Be prepared to adjust your life to a “new normal” and it is not one that will worry about hair cuts or grabbing a beer with your bros.

fahim7811,"Ok so this is going to be long. Please be patient and answer only if you have sufficient knowledge on this.

5-6 days ago, my father fell sick (fever) all of a sudden. He had no weakness, or any alarming symptoms. After one day, he cured completely. But the day he recovered, he fell sick again. We suspected that he turned on the ceiling fan at full speed even though he just recovered which caused the fever. 
The next morning, my mother fell onto bed too. She also had fever. But let me tell you that her main problem was her Urinary Tract Infection for which she was suffering from pain in the abdomen.
The same day mid-day, I caught fever too. I've had fever 1.5 months before as well, so I know how it was affecting me. My body was warm but wasn't that much painful like earlier fevers. It was like my body is fighting to not catch fever. My mom got somewhat recovered that evening. 
Please be noted that my parents and I (later that night) took Napa Extend (665g paracetamol) and Cef-3 (Cefixime Trihydrate, antibiotic). These medicines seemed to work after taking. But after it's effect goes away, fever again attacks. 
My father had recovered completely but again fell sick. 
In my case, I caught fever 2 times, then it stopped coming back for one day. But after recovering, my head was aching unbearably which was weird because I don't have any serious migraine problem. Today, after bathing after 2 days, I again caught the fever. Not that serious but my body is very warm. My father is in a mid state of recovery and sick. My mother seems to have little problem in midst this situation.
For the last 7 days, my heart was pounding for no reason for a short time which occurred 3-4 times meanwhile.
Is this coronavirus? Or something else? The fever recovers, then comes back, then again recovers. I'm very tensed.  Please help me.",1590326672,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gp59lh/daily_discussion_post_may_23_questions_images/frnt9as/,fan,2020-05-24

borghive,"My salon owners are foaming at the mouth to open. They think, anyone that is scared or doesn't want to come back is a ""being mislead by the media"" their words here. They really don't think this virus is that serious. All they care about is getting us back into the salon and packing in our clients.

They are so butt hurt too over the extra $600 a week UC benefits as well. They think that if those payments weren't going out that people would be more desperate to return to work. It is a good thing our state still has salons closed, but that is about to come to an end. I'd wager we have about 2 more weeks before we open.

The other ironic thing, is that my clients have been non-stop harassing me since the lockdown started asking me to come to their house and asking when we are going to open. A lot of these people are older folks that probably wouldn't fair well if they caught covid too. We have a lot of middle age, well off, affluent white collar clients.

bertbarndoor,"I got a medical test today at a lab. I’ve read that doctors are perplexed about why cases keep going up in Ontario and Quebec. I have answers. Here is why people keep contracting coronavirus. Source: senior internal control and risk assurance consultant for one of the Big Four accounting firms.

The clinic or lab—doesn’t matter which one, I’m sure these scenarios are commonplace. I am wearing gloves, one of my construction breathing masks, and swim goggles (eyes are open holes in your head with membranes which are more than capable of contracting the coronavirus, as with other openings to your head such as your nose or mouth). I show up, line queueing outside, social distancing being observed. Over the next 10 minutes saw no less than 10 “close encounters” where people walked through other people’s airspace or “lung exhaust”. Few people were wearing masks (estimate 10%). Simple droplet/aerosol transmission scenario #1.

Add to that, the location of a medical clinic has a higher than average risk profile (perhaps significantly) due to prevalence of sick and older people requiring medical tests (weaker immune systems, more prone to contracting coronavirus). Simple transmission scenario #1b (force multiplier in effect).

There are three areas to this clinic, one main clinic open concept reception area with testing areas walled off with cubical walls; a separate glass enclosed building entrance or foyer area outside of the medical office; and the outside sidewalk exterior of the building. People were socially distancing outside the exterior on the sidewalk as the first phase of waiting. The second phase of waiting was usually two people inside the enclosed building entrance/foyer (perhaps 150 square feet). The third waiting area was outside on the sidewalk or exterior of the clinic. Multiple studies have demonstrated that in a closed in area where people share air, the risk of contracting coronavirus can be significantly higher than a ventilated or outdoor area. For instance, one particularly interesting study contact traced a sick restaurant patron who sat near a fan which proceeded to blow his “coronavirus filled lung exhaust” all over the restaurant. Every restaurant goer who sat downwind from the fan that night contracted the virus. So, the two patients at any given time who were waiting in the small glass enclosed foyer area, that is simple droplet/aerosol transmission #2. As with the first example, given this is a medical clinic, #2b is going to be a riskier force multiplied scenario again.

So I get called finally. I go in and the intake staff member asks me some medical questions (good control) to see if I have symptoms or have travelled recently. Just as an aside, for people not aware, emerging evidence has indicated for months now that COVID19 can be asymptomatic in possibly up to 25%-50% of people. So while it does help to screen out obviously sick people who are definitely contagious, I just want to point out to everyone how weak this control really is. If a farmer had a fox in the henhouse problem and a salesman sold him a robot that only allowed entry to the hen house by hens, and vaporized all foxes on contact, the farmer might be inclined to purchase the system. However, if the system had a 25% fail rate, whereby the robot doors opened up for every 4th fox or so, the farmer would still have a henhouse full of dead chickens, all day, every day, take it to the bank. Or think of it like playing Russian roulette with a 2 chamber gun. I don’t care how lucky you are, no one can flip tails 30 times in a row. 

After answering the questions, the clinic intake staff member insisted that she give me a squirt of hand sanitizer. I had gloves, but this is still a good control. During the squirt, the staff member hit my hand with the bottle. Very low risk here, however if the bottle in the medical office were contaminated (this is an extremely possible scenario) the physical contact could have transferred the virus to my hand. If my hand then goes somewhere it shouldn’t, or touches something else like a door handle, or an interac payment terminal, the virus could be spread around. I won’t call this a full-fledged scenario, I will lump it in with the next one. 

After finishing with the intake, I am directed to the second intake staff member who asks for my health card. I had it to her, she hands it to me. The staff member does not sanitize or wash her hands between patients. Thus, if anyone in the chain of patients had COVID19, and it was on their hands, and they handed something to someone else, it could transfer to their hands. And then to their desk, and their pen, and their keyboard, etc. Then, if they get another patient in the long line with another case, they do it all over again, and get it all over their work area and themselves. And then they hand you back your card and you put that in your pocket or your wallet and go on with your day. Later, it is in your house. Simple transmission scenario #3. Medical clinic, not a retail store, force multiplier scenario #3b.

One of the medical tests is not covered by OHIP, I have to pay. Credit card comes out, oops over a hundred dollars, can’t tap. She hands be the terminal. There are some issues, takes 3 attempts. Have to handle it and punch in pin code. I mention to staff member that his machine is a little Typhoid Mary. The staff member responds that everything is. Small point of order here. While risk is certainly present in many scenarios, oftentimes one can reduce their risk profile substantially by identifying high risk behaviours and implementing mitigation strategies. The staff member’s response although probably driven by frustration and a sense of hopelessness, nevertheless reveals the truth that people who should be interested in stemming the tide of infection are either clueless or are not in a position to assess relative risk levels. Unfortunately the end result is that the interact payment machine is structurally required in their business model and they aren’t looking to change it. We are months in to this pandemic and medical facilities still require you to lick the coronavirus pole on entry to a facility and hand off the COVID19 baton to the next person who walks into the clinic. Simple transmission scenario #4, but again a much riskier environment so #4b.

After exchanging the health cards and after handing the payment terminal back and forth, I am told to take a seat in the semi-socially distance interior clinic waiting area. I ask how long it will be and am told 5 minutes. I say that I will just be outside on the sidewalk and if they could just give me a wave when ready I will come in (entire clinic is plate glass windows with 100% views of the outside). The staff member had an emotional reaction. I say this without emotion. I have seen this reaction before during the pandemic. It is a feeling of, if I have to go through this, then so do you. It was a mild reaction which only manifested in a facial expression, a tone of voice change, and a couple of snippy exchanges. “Actually, it will be closer to 2 minutes.” “Well, can I wait outside (5 feet away) for 2 minutes then?” Look of irritation from her and silence ensues.  The first intake staff member then chimes in to deescalate the tension and says for sure I can wait outside and she will wave when I can come in. Now, I had to push for this. I had to persist through a casual denial of the request and then made to suffer social anxiety for my (“ridiculous”) request. I don’t mention this because I am emotionally traumatized or feel this treatment was monstrous in any way, I simply say that this is what people have to fight thorough, even to take a baseline level of precaution. The fact that this lowers the risk for the staff as well, yet seemingly this is not understood by the staff, is somewhat bizarre at this point. I can certainly understand that the logistics of such a process may be more involved than “the before time” but it is still inherently doable.

So instead of waiting in the 10x10 foot waiting room with the other 4 patients not wearing any PPE or masks, I wait outside on the sidewalk. I am then called (5) minutes later, and I go in and get my test. The end.

To sum up, could have contracted COVID19 today several times in a very straightforward way. This is not perplexing at all.

\-Social distancing transmission vectors waiting outside line

\-Shared airspace in a small foyer transmission

\-Shared airspace inside clinic, challenging/impossible to social distance

\-Exchange of health card, use of and exchange of interac payment machine, no sanitation between patients.

Anyway, with the weather improving and as Canada begins to open up with the numbers going in the wrong direction, my professional opinion is that we are in for a rough ride. It doesn’t help when even the most basic and obvious low hanging fruit is apparently still out of grasp to even those in the medical space. Maybe public health should hire a few accountants like me—different skill set than the docs.

Also he wasn't elected mayor, he has been elected to different positions in Baltimore for the last 24 years, so I think your really ignoring the fact he's mayor because he was elected to the position that becomes mayor in these situations. 

Lastly, your calling him a dictator? Why? He's doing exactly what every mayor in the US is doing, using their office to protect public safety and weight that against shutdown.

“Although the collective safety profiles of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are relatively favorable, both drugs block the KCNH2-encoded hERG/Kv11.1 potassium channel and can prolong potentially the QTc. In at-risk individuals, these so-called hERG-blockers can precipitate DI-TdP or worse, DI-SCD, especially with chronic use (Table 1). As a result, the number of DI-SCDs attributable to hydroxychloroquine in particular is not trivial (Table 1). With the theoretical possibility that a significant proportion of the world population could receive hydroxychloroquine as first-line prophylaxis or treatment, including an estimated 3 million individuals with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), the number of hydroxychloroquine-mediated DI-SCDs could rise precipitously unless appropriate QTc monitoring algorithms are instituted. This risk of DI-SCD could be further amplified if multiple medications, each with their own QTc prolonging/torsadogenic potential (i.e. chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin and/or lopinavir/ritonavir), are used in combination (Table 1).“ end quote",1590187265,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gojqi1/daily_discussion_post_may_22_questions_images/frhv797/,safety,2020-05-22

skepticaleconomist,"Well you shouldn’t use cloth masks because they’re worthless — 97% of particles make their way through most cotton masks. Researchers suggest you need as many as 6 layers of fabric to match the particle capture rate of surgical masks.

Wearing a mask is good. It signals to people you’re taking the pandemic seriously. Other than that, unless you’re in a closed space, using a properly fitted mask, AND social distancing, those masks aren’t going to help much. 

People ignore the fact that prior to Coronavirus, cloth masks were not considered adequate facial covering to prevent micro particle transmission. They carry a relative risk 13x higher than surgical masks and have been scientifically proven to be in effective at preventing flu-like illness among HEALTHCARE WORKERS. 

This mask issue has ridden a wave of dubious assumptions and overconfidence in the safety masks can provide. I would even argue that to be pro-mask at this point in the pandemic is to essentially be pro-business to the extent that business owners want to reopen early. If you’re able to boost the messaging that masks serve as an effective replacement and transmission deterrent, then you can open up the economy sooner. 

The best science to date in favor of cloth masks is an experiment with hamsters. RCT studies show that cloth masks are ineffective at preventing micro particle transmission and may pose an increased danger if not cleaned and worn properly.

The_Adventurist,"This is exactly the thought process going through millions of Americans minds.

This is exactly why the US is fucked for the foreseeable future.

The first month of a pandemic is the most critical time for a reason. If you act quickly and decisively, you can contain it like Vietnam did and reopen in a very short amount of time with relative confidence in your safety in public.

If you fail that, you can still make up for it with aggressive testing, enforced quarantines, contact tracing, etc etc and still open up later, once you can definitively say your cases are shrinking or zero, and people can come back out with confidence in their safety.

If you fail to do all of that, as the US has, and you open up anyway, people won't be confident in their safety and they won't go out and spend money like they did before. Even if you do somehow manage to contain it completely and eradicate it (impossible when you open up while cases are rising like the US has) people still won't believe that you have and they still won't return to normal. That means your economic recover is going to take SO MUCH LONGER than everyone elses and, in many industries, there won't be a full recovery at all.

It is a systemic problem, because the majority of employees don't care --many think they are paid to nap--and those who do care cannot break through the antipathy, take care of everyone in these homes, or get management to care about anything but warm bodies for staff and the bottom line. It often takes family intervention to keep patients/residents safe. Without regular interaction with family or loved ones, there is no one who will monitor the safety and well-being of residents without counterbalancing the burden or accountability that actually caring takes.",1590195897,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gore3l/20yearold_suspect_arrested_after_brutal_beating/fri9yko/,safety,2020-05-22

afreakinchorizo,"It's a catch-22. As a teacher, I can tell you 99% of teachers don't want to go back to school until schools can take the necessary precautions to help keep students and teachers as safe as possible. Obviously, I understand we'll never get that risk down to zero without a vaccine, but there are things we can do to greatly mitigate the risk without a vaccine. The problem is all of these things (more regular cleaning of school, smaller classes, staggered schedules to support social distancing, etc.) cost a lot of money. And because of the economic downturn of the pandemic schools are going to have less money. Since school budgets were already tight and underfunded to begin with and that schools need MORE money to help ensure safety, while they are going to be getting LESS money from the state... I'm just really at a loss as to how we solve this one. 

But ultimately, I agree with you - we need to get back sometime to help protect the learning loss.

If you're looking for a reason to reopen society, then it wouldn't make sense to exclude any of the data from any population no matter how they're housed. 

You can't make a decision of safety based solely on how the disease impacts the most-fit individuals when those individuals are responsible for spreading it to the less-fit individuals. 

If you know that opening society back up will increase the number of ""regular"" infections by 25%, but double the amount of nursing homes that are infected, then vulnerable populations suffer disproportionately more from the effects of the disease.

skepticaleconomist,"Yoooo, let me paste my recent comment with a source that you conveniently ignored. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It’s important to recognize the status quo of scientists is that these cloth masks do not significantly reduce risk. Given the overwhelming conclusions that proper training is needed for all [people] to learn how to properly use a mask (https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577.responses#covid-19-shortages-of-masks-and-the-use-of-cloth-masks-as-a-last-resort ). 

This mask wearing MUST be coupled with social distancing practices, or else the marginal benefits that cloth masks may provide will be inconsequential beyond signaling your seriousness about the pandemic. 

I think it’s important to note this [Hamster study—https://www.google.com/amp/s/medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-hamster-masks-coronavirus-scientists.amp) may be the most favorable research in support of masks. 

An earlier RCT study (https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577.short) found significant drawbacks in the effectiveness of preventing disease transmission when it came to cloth masks. 

I’ve been pointing people to this study to stress the importance that MASK WEARING ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH.

I was thinking of a case I know where the mom was married, got pregnant, had the kid, got divorced (not sure on the order there), remarried while the kid was still under 2, had kid2 with the new husband when Kid 1 was 3.  The steparent was the only dad kid1 really knew (Kid1 saw his real dad very rarely and was adopted by stepdad at around 10ish).  The step father died after kid1 was 20 and kid2 was 17.  To my mind both Kid1 and Kid2 should be considered to have grown up in a 2 parent household, but an argument could certainly be made that neither one did.  Add in, had the 2ish year gap between husbands happened in the middle of childhood rather than on the ends, I would feel it more counted towards not growing up with 2 parents.",1590188826,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/goh9o9/schools_row_warning_that_it_is_impossible_to/frhxyia/,feel,2020-05-22

Now everyone is making it sound like every time you go out without a mask, you're going to die, and that the mask thing started months ago.

What I do care about is they confuse their crutch with a necessity and try to push it on someone.

I realize there's a lot of debate about the odds of catching CV-19 outdoors, but I've seen enough in terms of credible studies and analysis to convince me the risk is definitely non-zero.  How high above non-zero is TBD..but anything other than zero risk is to me, reason enough to wear a mask outdoors ALWAYS - unless we're in an area where I'm confident there have been zero people for the past several hours as CV-19 has been show to hang in the air for up to 3 hours.  And where we live, there's no such area, so we wear our masks.

It does make me a bit crazy to see so many people outside walking around, generally close to each other, with no masks.

“I was bored and there’s nothing else to do,” he said about the parties.

On Friday, 300 to 400 people filled the warehouse. On Saturday, hundreds more showed up. Mobley broke open a coronavirus-themed pinata filled with mini bottles of Rumple Minze, and photos show the crowd of people packed together to take a picture.

When asked if he felt that hosting the party was irresponsible, Mobley said he had no comment. “I feel like your body is going to be stronger if you’re out around people and — I don’t know,” Mobley said. “I don’t want to get into this politics stuff. I didn’t really think about it.”

He said he believes everyone is going to catch COVID-19 at some point and “being cooped up in the house is not going to keep people from getting it.” He has known several people with coronavirus.

When asked if he would have another party, Mobley said if the bars were not opening back up Friday, then he probably would.

Hundreds lambasted Mobley on social media over the parties, which he posted about on his public Facebook. Various Fort Worth-based Facebook groups shared the photos and criticized Mobley and those at the party.

In turn, Mobley posted screenshots of those posts and said his “new job is pissing off Karens.” He specifically targeted a private Facebook group for Fort Worth women.

“I kind of wanted to troll them,” Mobley said about the women’s group. “To be honest, it didn’t upset me at all, it kind of made me laugh more than anything.”

Fort Worth police showed up at the party on Friday in response to several noise complaints, Mobley said. Officers “were cool” and “were just mad about the noise,” he said, but added he did not talk to officers directly. He said they eventually “kind of just went away and never came back.” The party lasted until about 3:30 a.m. on Friday.",1590192213,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gouuvq/texas_man_threw_400person_coronavirusthemed/fri3v43/,feel,2020-05-22

I play Bach on weekdays and Dizzy Gillespie and Miles not so loud Friday's thru Sundays from 8 - 930. no noise on after that but it's more and more like the blitz in WW2 England after that in my place. I work 2 hours away and have been trying to keep up but one has to pay rent so there's really no staying home no matter what my fear factor level is. I do feel bad for younger people because I got to go have uninterrupted fun when I was 20 and I know how necessary that is to develop your personality and keep your sanity. I envy you getting up to the skills because I don't drive and dude I'm really sorry the Karens are everywhere  I live with two next door and on top of me. I don't understand the drive to goto sleep at 8pm and wake up at 5am and that it's wrong for everyone else to do what you don't do.,1590193424,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gomg99/dr_anthony_fauci_says_staying_closed_for_too_long/fri5wbz/,feel,2020-05-22

SluttyMossadAgent,"The article is a little more nuanced than this. Fauci is still very pro-caution. This headline doesn't capture everything Fauci said and seems a little out of context. 

&gt; **“I don’t want people to think that any of us feel that staying locked down for a prolonged period of time is the way to go,” he told CNBC.**   
&gt;  
&gt;Fauci also cautioned states against reducing social distancing measures too quickly, adding they must take “very significant precautions.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“In general, I think most of the country is doing it in a prudent way,” he said. “There are obviously some situations where people might be jumping over that. I just say please proceed with caution if you’re going to do that.”",1590193447,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gomg99/dr_anthony_fauci_says_staying_closed_for_too_long/fri5xpa/,feel,2020-05-22

The_Adventurist,"This is exactly the thought process going through millions of Americans minds.

This is exactly why the US is fucked for the foreseeable future.

The first month of a pandemic is the most critical time for a reason. If you act quickly and decisively, you can contain it like Vietnam did and reopen in a very short amount of time with relative confidence in your safety in public.

If you fail that, you can still make up for it with aggressive testing, enforced quarantines, contact tracing, etc etc and still open up later, once you can definitively say your cases are shrinking or zero, and people can come back out with confidence in their safety.

If you fail to do all of that, as the US has, and you open up anyway, people won't be confident in their safety and they won't go out and spend money like they did before. Even if you do somehow manage to contain it completely and eradicate it (impossible when you open up while cases are rising like the US has) people still won't believe that you have and they still won't return to normal. That means your economic recover is going to take SO MUCH LONGER than everyone elses and, in many industries, there won't be a full recovery at all. 

Our government is so opposed to the idea of using the state to enforce a quarantine and also using that state to provide for peoples basic needs during that quarantine that they've fucked the economy up for average Americans for years.

YEARS!

People don't realize how deep this wound is because we're still in shock, it's still numb, but we are definitely going to feel it relatively soon.

I am going to leave the country, at least for a few years. The benefits of being a broke property-less millennial is there's nothing tying me down here at all and so many benefits to leaving, so that's my only solution. America's raging dumpster-fire of a country will still affect the entire world, so I'll never actually escape it, but standing next to a dumpster-fire is better than standing in one.",1590193703,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gokm4t/a_majority_of_americans_say_they_wont_go_to_the/fri6d2v/,feel,2020-05-22

c0mputar,"I feel like a lot of people commentating on this article are interpreting Fauci's words the wrong way. He didn't say we shouldn't wait too long before relinquishing orders pertaining to business closures and other social distancing measures otherwise irreparable damage could be caused, period. He said nothing of the sort in the interview.

He was always careful to say that any reopening done anywhere should be following the phased approach outlined in the government guidelines that he has been championing for weeks.

That said, the comments made by the CEO in that interview were retarded. Fauci was just thoughtfully answering the question without ridiculing him.",1590194149,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gomg99/dr_anthony_fauci_says_staying_closed_for_too_long/fri73h2/,feel,2020-05-22
mkev119,"As a State employee for the Department of Health and Human Services, I feel she is doing a wonderful job of keeping us informed. We’ve received countless updates from her, as well as gratitude for the job we are doing for the counties we cover. She always tries to promote a positive morale, from what I’ve seen. When everything started, my fiancé and several people in his DHS office fell ill. My county office just outside of Lansing also had several people with ‘pneumonia, bronchitis, strep, etc’ due to working face-to-face with the public... myself included. As we were unable to get tested at the time, I can only imagine some had COVID. I agree with the social distancing efforts, and am sad to see the hate Whitmer is getting from her decisions. This is true even after my wedding and the adoption of our foster child has had to be postponed. Better safe than sorry.
Armed protests on her lawn, slanderous billboards from Students for Trump on the highway, people posting that they want her dead? Why?

vanillamasala,I wish this actually computed in my brain. I get what you’re saying but I can’t “feel” these numbers.  I have to revert to Fahrenheit and think: ok 212 is boiling and I never felt weather like that.  In my city it’s currently around 96 degrees F so I guess that’s around half-ish of boiling so maybe that means it’s 45-ish? But google tells me that’s off by 10 C so I’m kinda hopeless. Someone once told me a scale by 10 degrees of how weather feels and that sort of worked but I forgot it.,1590194521,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/goj5g0/india_sees_biggest_single_day_spike_with_6k_cases/fri7pec/,feel,2020-05-22
Progman12093,"So this is a great example of the problem with this sub: you said hundreds of thousands of deaths, while someone replying to you said a million.  none of you have any damn clue how to model this.

And this is why Trump was 110% right to leave it up to the states.  We need empirical evidence through testing.  Not only, constitutionally, is it right to leave up to states/municipalities, but it also allows us to ignore every armchair expert with an internet connection, and instead rely on empirical data.  I personally feel like if we were to have rather restricted elderly and immune-deficient individuals, we would ""be in a much better place"", but I also know we don't have enough data to prove that.

I would argue we need several more weeks of state experimentation to quantify both the risk and reward of opening up.  And yes - we need to consider both.  Trying to insist on not opening up until we are ""risk-free"" or that ""no incremental life is lost"" is juvenile and futile.  We absolutely need to manage risk, like we do in every single day of our lives.",1590194526,Coronavirus,/r/Coronavirus/comments/goicek/the_death_toll_in_sweden_is_catastrophically_high/fri7prg/,feel,2020-05-22

khalifornia420,"Agreed. Tbh I think a lot of the people on this sub are completely wrong about the general opinions of the majority of people.

I work at a grocery store - based on today, it’s extremely obvious the restaurants are going to be completely fucking packed this weekend.

People are itching to go out, and they are preparing for a fun and social weekend.

I live in california in an extremely liberal area and nearly everyone is over the lockdown and thinks it’s time to open socializing up again. The beaches have been packed since they open too (no, my area is not on the beach nor in a touristy area, but I’ve seen social media posts from friends).

It’s interesting to see the sparse people who come out once a month and seem to think everyone is on the same page as them. It really showed me how effective an echo chamber is...No, the majority of people do not feel the same as you.
